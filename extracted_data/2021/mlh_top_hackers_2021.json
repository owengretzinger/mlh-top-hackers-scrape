    "about": "Zane first got interested in programming in middle school when he started making games in Unity, but when he went to high school and found a lackluster computer science program, he took initiative and found programs outside of school. He joined the Technology Student Association, an engineering program that annually hosts nationwide competitions, and started a programming club at his school where he discovered hackathons while researching activities they could do. Soon after this discovery, he attended Hackital 2019 and had an amazing first experience spending 36 straight hours hacking, attending workshops, listening to keynotes, and meeting his fellow competitors. He has been hooked on hackathons since, having supported over 40 events as a hacker, mentor, judge, and workshop host.\n\nGrowing up as a first-generation low-income minority student, Zane lacked access to resources and communities to feed his interest in programming, so he understands the barriers that prevent people like himself from becoming high-level engineers or executives. He found the internet fascinating as a child, a place for people of all backgrounds to communicate, learn, and expand their worldviews, and the internet helped him gain confidence and meet some of his closest friends. Hackathons had a similar impact and gave Zane an avenue to pursue his tech interests, growing his programming knowledge and teaching important life lessons in optimism, determination, and resourcefulness from seeing his projects through to the end whether they fail or are saved from collapse. Hackathons served as an equalizer, allowing him to gain knowledge, connections, and experience that he never could have otherwise.\n\nHoya Hacks sticks out in his mind as an event that helped him grow, as his team was full of beginners and non-CS majors and he guided them through the waves of joy at workshops and the frustration of unexpected challenges and debugging. On the event\u2019s second day, Zane\u2019s only ride home had to leave early, and he recalls being disheartened that he would leave his teammates at their first event with a bad experience. Just as Zane was about to leave, he got a message from an MLH representative that went to his university offering a ride back to campus; He was elated and made it back in time to finish the project with his team. Despite the difficulties they faced and not winning at the event, Zane\u2019s teammates were amazed by the hackathon experience. The experience motivated Zane to focus on leadership, and he wanted to give back to the hacker community so he became an event organizer.\n\nWorking at gender-focused hackathons like Technica and HackViolet, Zane helps develop diversity and inclusivity initiatives in hopes of spreading them to all hackathons, making the entire ecosystem more welcoming to people of all backgrounds. Zane is also planning to host his own hackathon that targets first-generation students: FirstGenHacks! If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out to him via LinkedIn. While the event is still in its planning stages, Zane is dedicated to creating more inclusive events that send a message to students of all majors and backgrounds: Hackathons are for everyone!\n\nAs an organizer, Zane is always working to improve the hackathon experience for attendees, and he even helps consult other hackathon organizers to improve their events. One time the organizing team for a hackathon reached out to Zane after hearing about his positive impact on another hackathon, so he joined the event as a mentor, judge, and workshop host. Some attendees experienced rude comments, trolls, and were even insulted by another hackathon\u2019s organizer. Zane had never seen such behavior in all the hackathons he had attended, so he brought it to the attention of the event\u2019s organizing team. The team\u2019s members were all women from underrepresented backgrounds which Zane loved, and after the event, he scheduled a call with them to discuss ways to make future events have a more welcoming, inclusive, and positive environment. They talked about insights from the event and common challenges that virtual hackathons face, as well as acknowledging the strengths and highlights of the largely spectacular event. Zane maintains open communication with the organizers, giving advice when needed to help them overcome challenges in shifting to virtual events, and listening to the unique problems that the all-female-minority team has to help create inclusive solutions.\n\nAt Cypher VI, Zane created his favorite hackathon project, Last Minute Meals. The project tackles the issue of food waste and sustainability by keeping track of the user\u2019s \u201cvirtual fridge\u201d based on the items on their receipt, giving them reminders for when items are about to go bad. The app gives advice on effective recycling based on the foods\u2019 packaging, and, given how many people are learning to cook during the pandemic, it recommends dishes to users with items already in their fridge based on their dietary preferences. Zane loved this project because many people are just as busy if not more so right now, with tighter spending budgets and fewer options to eat out, so its ability to help people save money and reduce their grocery waste serves as a useful tool for their daily lives. It also allows them to easily incorporate eco-friendly habits such as composting into their lives, and is a product that Zane as a home cook finds extremely useful.\n\nHackathons have taught Zane many skills that prepare him for his career and professional life as a whole. Learning cutting-edge technologies such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality are more practical skills than the theory-based education at university. Aside from technical experiences, the challenge of coming up with an idea for a project then learning new languages and tech on the spot to build a prototype is an amazing learning experience that hones creative and improvisational skills. Networking at events, engaging with judges, and talking to other attendees with similar interests has helped improve Zane\u2019s communication skills as well as expanded his worldviews in ways that impact his everyday life and work ethic.",

    "about": "Technology, programming, and hackathons have become Satakshi\u2019s life, and she loves every bit of it. She finds the process of building new projects, debugging them, and further improving them to be peaceful. She feels inexplicable happiness from taking ideas in her head and turning them into tangible projects. Satakshi has very keen observational skills so she is always thinking about how to improve a project from a user\u2019s perspective and eager to figure out the technical implementations\u2014as a hobby she is building a presentation on different ways Google can improve their various products. She doesn\u2019t favor a certain type of technology, having done projects in AR/VR, cybersecurity, machine learning, website development, and more; rather, she enjoys the journey of figuring out how to use tools to turn her mental images into reality. Above all else, she is a competitive programmer who loves solving problems and participating in live contests, and hackathons are where she finds peace.\n\nSatakshi feels that being a passionate developer and competitive programmer, such as she is, is an important combination for a technical mind to prosper. Her innovative ideas and technical skills are reflected in the impressive number of hackathon accolades under her belt obtained from working on only 12 projects. She has won an international hackathon, ranked in the top 20 out of 500 teams at a national hackathon, qualified for Google Code Jam and the Facebook Hacker Cup Qualifications Round in her first year at college, a PB of ranking top 900 among 33000+ participants in a Codeforces contest, worked on India's First VR-Book Project and was selected by Google to be among the top 126 of 15000+ applicants chosen for their WE Program. Satakshi also organizes free workshops for people outside of her college and WTEF Fellowship spaces on a number of topics, as she believes in the power of spreading knowledge.\n\nThe Peer Programming Hub is a community for Competitive Programmers that Satakshi is especially proud of, as she founded the free CP Camp, designed its program, and organizes events so that programming enthusiasts can hone their skills. The camp is based on the idea of maintaining a streak, competing with others to do coding activities as many days in a row as possible which helps to reinforce what they learn. The camp has 4 different difficulty levels\u2014Sergeants, Knights, Captains, Commanders\u2014and the final survivors with the longest coding streaks become WarLords. Satakshi has herself designed the entire Game Code, using Web Scraping, in just a span of 2 days.\n\nSatakshi first learned of the hacker community when a member of the Google WE\u00a0 community asked if someone had prior AR-VR knowledge to help with a project. Satakshi reached out, and they became friends as they partnered up for her first hackathon, To the Moon and Hack 2020. The plan was to build a rocket launch model using AR, and Satakshi suggested they build an entire universe experience\u2014the project won second place at the international event, a major win for her first hackathon.\n\nDuring Halloween in 2020, Satakshi participated in MLH\u2019s Hack or Treat event and built her favorite project VampAR, a virtual Halloween party hosted in AR. The event had already started when she decided to participate, so with no team members, she asked her brother and sister to be her teammates. They had no AR experience, but Satakshi had fun helping them learn throughout the event and found it awesome helping two non-technical people build a technical project. They also filmed the entire demo video together which was a blast, and ended up having a great Halloween party in person too.\n\nWhether building projects at hackathons or organizing events, Satakshi is a proper team player. She has a very organized style of work that considers the strengths and skills of each individual on her team, and she is quick to think of solutions to any problems that arise. In organizing events, Satakshi tries her best to suggest ideas that are beneficial for both the organizers and the attendees; for example, in organizing live workshops for her college\u2019s GDSC and IEEE communities, Satakshi suggested the use of Google Meet or Zoom over Youtube to livestream. More people watch Youtube streams after they are finished than watch them live, while Google Meet or Zoom would promote live attendance and interaction and organizers could still upload the recording after the fact.\n\nHackathons have helped Satakshi become able to think of great project ideas quickly, build her skills, and then start working on the project. This spontaneity and willingness to take initiative have given her valuable organizational and leadership skills. In building projects with teams of people she didn\u2019t yet know over consecutive days, Satakshi gained meaningful communication skills in learning how to interpret and work with the ideas that others are trying to convey. Also, learning to pitch projects with teammates in the best way possible for a panel of judges is a business skill that is extremely valuable in technological fields, and which Satakshi will certainly use in her future profession.",

    "name": "Ebtesam Al Haque",

    "website": "",
    "about": "Ebtesam\u2019s entry into the tech world started when she got her first personal computer at the age of seven. With it, she had the opportunity to explore all sorts of career paths and opportunities. Her innate desire to check out every path available left her with the decision that technology was the best way for her to make an impact. With this decision in mind, Ebtesam took to programming as an undergrad.\n\nNeeding something productive to do at a time when we were all stuck inside, Ebtesam scrolled through Eventbrite, where she came across HackDSC. Having never attended a hackathon before, she quickly signed up. As the event drew closer, the task of a time-constricted project seemed daunting, but her anxieties were quickly washed away by a welcoming group of other hackers. They all agreed to have fun and just create something without the added pressure of needing the project to be fully functional or even a prize winner. With the stakes set for themselves, Ebtesam and her team were in control of the event, and it turned out better than she imagined. She learned new coding languages, attended workshops, and made friends. The whole thing was a lightbulb moment. She now felt the desire to feel an interest and immediately acted upon it for the sake of learning rather than bookmarking an interesting topic for later.\n\nHer passion for reading whenever she could brought her to new events with a whole new set of skills, which she implemented while building Safe Walk, her favorite project yet. As an attendee of LA Hacks, she implemented that social change that she hoped to bring by building a project with collective safety in mind, by using a SpotCrime API to map out the safest walking routes for anybody in need. Shee loves hackathons like this because of the emphasis on honing both technical and soft skills. Effective presentation, time management, well-scheduled collaboration, all are just as crucial to career development as the actual knowledge of coding languages. It also helps her keep an ear to the ground when it comes to emerging technologies impacting the sector of the world that she cares so much about. These lessons have given her the confidence to start bringing ideas that used to seem unattainable to life.\n\nThe question of what Ebtesam wanted to end up doing was growing more and more daunting until hackathons came into her life. The nights of work as a team left her with a clear image of how she wanted to progress. She is now working on her PhD in Computer Sciences at George Mason University. But, the educational conviction that comes with studying under such a prestigious name didn\u2019t begin immediately. As a minority among her peers, with cultural norms that are not conducive for someone like her to immediately thrive, Ebtesam felt the toll. Because of these norms, fellow female hackers were often left with less available resources that would provide valuable opportunities to further their career. At first, she was scared to set big goals for herself based on the collective attitudes of others. This differed from her upbringing, where she was overwhelmingly supported by those around her. Knowing that people like her family members wanted her to succeed more than anything, she didn\u2019t give up, and she found hackathons. With these odds stacked against her, she had even more of a reason to work to jump that gap.\n\nHaving moved to Bangladesh to attend one of the best universities in the region, she was very excited to be studying in the country where her parents were originally from. Studying at an international university, she expected to be greeted by a diverse community but was surprised when the reality of being a woman in tech hit her. She was among the first batch of women accepted into the institution which has been an all-boys university up until 2017. This mentality seemed to be that of her male classmates as well, some of whom believed women didn\u2019t belong in tech which was detrimental to her confidence. Additionally, due to cultural norms, she was unable to attend hackathons as women generally didn\u2019t spend nights outside of their homes or walk around after sunset. This made it challenging to spend the traditional 24-36 hours at a hackathon.\n\nThe shift of hackathons from in-person to digital was one that greatly benefited Ebtesam. Now, she was able to hack and have the same experiences as her male counterparts. Without the worry of housing accommodations or safe transportation, she was able to code to her heart's content. Hackathons have truly helped Ebtesam to gain back her confidence, to set big goals for herself, and to make friends with hackers who supported her in the pursuit of a career in tech.\n\nHackDSC was a passion project, a group with the collective expectations to just have fun and learn along the way. Ebtesam has taken this mindset with her to all 109 hackathons that she has attended, and her knowledge has only compounded. Forty hackathon wins in the bag; not much could falter her belief in the idea of friendly, fun competition. Not every event had to be a win because she still left with valuable knowledge and experiences that she won\u2019t forget. Among the forty prizes that she has won at hackathons, she has a wide pool of potential products to build from her projects, which she hopes to accomplish as a postgrad.",

    "name": "Jacob Allen Kasner",

    "website": "",
    "about": "Until March 2020, Jacob\u2019s coding skills were limited to Scratch games and Lego Robotics from middle school. As the United States went into a national quarantine, he had to decide if he still wanted to start university when his freshman year could be fully remote. He did not want to start college virtually, but he also could not change his life trajectory based on an event outside of his control, so Jacob started to figure out how he could take a growth year while making it meaningful and effective. Coding and data science intrigued him but had nothing to do with his intended major of Biomedical Engineering, so he created a Codecademy account and started learning. Jacob joined the hacker community after finishing a Codecademy career path and started building his own useful projects. Until his first hackathon, he had a disconnect between practicing SQL and Python and building an app with them as tools, and IvyHacks helped him cross that bridge and recognize how much he already knew. While enjoying the team event overall, Jacob applied his newfound skills to practice developing software independently.\n\nHaving done mostly solo coding, Jacob wants to explore organizational software development as well as open-source contribution and management. Working in an organization will help him understand the impact of an immediately deployed software project, and open-source contributions will let him see the scope of an actively used software project, both of which will help him expand his understanding of coding at different scales in team dynamics and apply his skills more effectively in future workplaces. Hackathons have also helped Jacob learn to code in crunch time, which helps not only with meeting deadlines but also with quickly creating minimum viable products. He aims to regularly contribute to open source and continue developing projects individually as a way of helping the community and honing skills that will be relevant for his entire career.\n\nWhile it took a while for Jacob to understand technology, it has always been something that he has been fascinated by. His earliest exposure came from gaming consoles like the Nintendo DS Lite and Wii, and he used to frequently and gladly give technical support to friends, family, classmates, and even teachers, but he knew how much he had yet to explore in tech and did not feel like an expert. Learning to code in the past year has helped Jacob connect the dots and feel the deep sense of satisfaction that only comes from solving a long-sought-after question. Jacob finds the hacker community to be a really interesting group of people, and they have given him a new way to see problems when everyone shares a common tool to solve them. The community gave him the confidence to charge headfirst into daunting challenges knowing that at any moment he could call a friend to talk through an issue or do a quick web search to find a niche solution. The community has also given Jacob a sense of intellectually stimulating joy that exceeds his previous hobby, strategy board games. Jacob is glad he decided to learn to code and intends to work with the hacker community to tackle a wide range of inefficiencies.\n\nAlthough he has not organized a hackathon, Jacob frequently helps organize hackers at hackathons, bootcamps, and in classrooms by constructing teams that highlight and support each member\u2019s abilities to help them create a project they can all take pride in. Jacob helps teach hackers through mentorships where he clarifies concepts, and he was a teaching assistant at the Data Science 4 All boot camp where he hopes to return this summer to give back to the program that helped him learn coding and hone his own skills by teaching others. He also recently joined the German translation team for the system-design-primer, a popular interview prep resource on GitHub, after becoming conversationally fluent in German since starting to learn in March 2020.\n\nAs an MLH Fellow, Jacob worked with the United States Air Force to create a command-line data translator for electromagnetic environment combat simulators, which involved using Python to take XML datatype for the interrupt-based system and convert it to ASCII for more modern systems. The MLH Fellowship allowed him to practice connecting his communication and programming skills by conveying information about development through weekly check-ins, explaining the latest improvements and asking the right questions to get past impediments. Working on the project let Jacob evolve his Python abilities to make more efficient and understandable code, and his partner\u2019s work in C++ exposed him to other implementation and organization ideas. He also honed his debugging skills, as fixing your own errors in an independent project is much different from finding and fixing issues related to a partner\u2019s code on a large-scale project. Such work taught Jacob how to review complex modular code and, with enough time, understand it as if he had written it himself. The MLH Fellowship really prepared Jacob to enter the software development workforce by setting him in a quasi-work environment with a coworker, project manager, and client team whose needs they satisfied, and he developed invaluable connections to people he can call upon in the future either for help or collaboration. When Jacob turns his focus back to bioengineering after starting university, he will gain domain knowledge that will only further supplement and add to the job-ready skills he acquired so early in life thanks to MLH and the hacker community.\n\nMQuicker is by far Jacob\u2019s favorite hack, a Python script that lets users quickly and easily check to see if their favorite manga have had new chapters published, supporting webcomics from a wide array of websites. Working on this project was the first time he automated a daily task and took it through the whole life cycle. In the beginning, he resisted expanding it for fear of judgment and disinterest, but his ambition and desire to continue making it better for himself pushed his development forward. From conception to release, Jacob spent two and a half months and hundreds of hours learning Python, debugging, and improving the codebase to incorporate web scraping, data management, and user interfacing. Expanding the project brought him to many barriers, and he loved breaking them down one by one. MQuicker is now an open-source project freely available for download through a shell script. Other open-source developers in the community reached out to him about contributing, so he added a feature backlog to the repository and began helping the junior developers help him. Jacob is looking forward to creating even better Hobbies & Leisure SaaS products in the future.\n\nThis summer, Jacob will work as a Software Engineering intern at SparrowFi, a start-up seeking to fix the shortfalls of student lending. His day-to-day work focuses on building out the serverless mobile backend using Amazon Web Services like Lambda, API Gateway, and AppSync. The experience is his first full-time job, and despite presenting him with great challenges, he enjoys gaining new skills by tackling and overcoming them.\n\nJacob takes pride in his rapid growth from writing his first SQL query in March of 2020 to helping Sparrow ready for launch in July 2021; it demonstrated his determination and commitment to improving as a hacker and sharing his work with the world. His unique choice to spend a growth year learning to code and immersing himself in the hacker community reflects how his intense interest in the field pushed him to disregard obstacles and refuse adherence to any one realm by branching out from Biomedical Engineering. Jacob has a hyper-practical view of coding which helped him quickly move from picking up basics to applying them in independent development, and he has many plans for future projects to continue his growth. He is less interested in where he is now and more focused on where he will go, hoping to carry his momentum forward as he enters the biomedical engineering field with a vision of using programming and biomedical data to develop life-changing software products.",

    "about": "When Mara first got to college, she wasn\u2019t sure about her Computer Science major. She explicitly chose the University of Virginia because of the good economics program they offered just in case she wanted to switch majors . She branched out into different groups, even joining ROTC for less than a month, thinking that the only way she could get a programming job was through the military. She felt as if she was barely getting a taste of what it meant to be a programmer. Coding classes just didn\u2019t show her what it\u2019s like to create a product.\n\nBut hackathons did.\n\nMara, like many young professionals hoping to start their career, felt intimidated by the coders in her immediate vicinity that rattled off tech jargon like \u2018linked lists\u2019 and \u2018the terminal\u2019. She had no idea of what these meant. After a semester of revising her resume, Mara heard whispers of hackathons, presented to her as a great opportunity to expand one's portfolio of personal projects. Luckily, an MLH sponsored hackathon, HooHacks, was just around the corner.\n\nMara applied, got accepted, and took to Facebook in hopes of finding the perfect group. Mara got some bites from fellow passionate hackers, and with her team of three total strangers, she hunkered down and got to work. The team consisted of two other first-timers and one hacker with 10 hackathons under their belt. Mara realized, with the help of this seasoned hacker, that you don\u2019t become a programmer overnight.\n\nThere are, however, many people that used to be in her shoes and want to help guide and show others the path that worked for them. This taught her that whenever she may feel overwhelmed, she can find solace in the belief that as long as she is persistent in her learning, she can do it.\n\nThe team spent 36 hours crafting an app that works to simplify syllabi and calendar syncing. The project wound up winning Best Beginner, but Mara\u2019s favorite memory of the event was taking caffeine-fueled, late-night walks with her teammates.\n\nShe swiftly felt impassioned to attend as many hacking events as possible, wherever they might take her. So far, she\u2019s been able to travel across the country to Los Angeles for AthenaHacks and soon, she hopes to take her skills across the world.\n\nAthenaHacks was an important moment for Mara. She and her friend, Danielle, decided to make the cross-country venture together to show what they had to offer. This was the perfect opportunity for the two friends, who had hopes of hosting their own hackathon soon after AthenaHacks took place, to gain insight into the world of hackathon management. They went into the event with the goal of going to workshops for the sake of seeing how they were run in mind, rather than brainstorming projects. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a majority of the workshops going virtual or unmanned. But Mara took this as an opportunity to adapt her ideas to the situation.\n\nThe pair pivoted to project creation after the unforeseen circumstances. They took inspiration from the prize tracks and crowdsourced ideas that worked for the goal of \u201cmaking the world a better place.\u201d This resulted in Mara creating a resource hub for the sake of empowering child abuse survivors to reach out and find help. Using HTML, CSS, JS and Microsoft Azure, Mara learned that hackathons rewarded the idea and the creativity behind every project more than they did bountiful technological experience. A mentor of the event even extensively helped in the workshopping process to make sure every track had been covered. The project won not one, but three prizes. Mara enjoys citing this event when speaking with anyone who feels nervous or discouraged about their first hackathon. It\u2019s intimidating, she knows. But hacking is about creating a product that is innovative and solves a real-world problem, not about who can code the fastest.\n\nOutside of hackathons, Mara is founder and president of the Girls Who Code (GWC) college loop, one of the largest in the nation. The core belief is that hackers are anywhere we use technology to solve our problems\u2014this guides the mission of GWC to build a community of hackers not limited to women and not limited to CS majors. GWC is the only diversity-focused coding organization on campus that has non-CS majors and men on the executive board. Mara has led the club in hosting networking events and workshops with companies such as Microsoft and Google.\n\nGWC led Mara to fulfilling her dreams of hosting a hackathon only eight months after the organization coalesced. Mara worked hard to make sure that attendees of the hackathon felt as comfortable as she was made to feel when she first started, even creating a pre-hackathon jumpstart program with team building sessions, idea generation assemblies and general help gatherings.\n\nMara hopes to make even further steps to make tech a more gender-inclusive field, focusing on resources for young women and other gender/agender minorities. On top of GWC, she started a female-centric mentorship program at Microsoft as an intern after she learned that only 29% of the entire company was female. This percentage was even lower after magnifying Microsoft\u2019s programming sector. In only a few weeks, the program gained traction and connected over 200 interns and full-time employees, bridging a very exposed gap in the system.\n\nAs a hacker, the process of creating self-projects in and out of the tech world drives Mara\u2019s work ethic. Mara aspires to become a CS educator, and recently, she has been given the opportunity to teach as a MLH Coach where she leads MLH Localhost workshops and helps staff hackathons around the world. Her workshops, reaching a viewership of 500 members, allow her to hone her skill of entertaining while educating and learning the basics of new technologies that everyone should have access to. She credits the support of her professors, teachers, and mentors as a large part of how she has gotten where she is today, and she is excited to give back to the next generation of hackers.",

    "about": "As president of his high school\u2019s programming club, Jesse focused on creating a space for members to learn coding languages and share their interests in software engineering. He realized that he can have a strong impact on a community by helping others collectively achieve more, providing an avenue to apply his passion for uplifting others. He initially did not pursue hackathons himself, as he felt underprepared and did not know where to start. After a semester of virtual computer science courses his Freshman year at university, and during a quiet winter break, Jesse mustered the courage to try his first hackathon\u2014Holiday Hacks hosted by MLH. He created SMSending Holiday Cards, an app for sending Hallmark holiday cards via text in a time when families could not gather due to the pandemic. He had no teammates at this first hackathon and did not win any prizes, yet Jesse gained confidence in himself for creating a working project in a short time span. Jesse also found inspiration from seeing other hackers\u2019 fantastic projects in the winner\u2019s gallery, making him excited for the skills and knowledge he would come to gain by working with other hackers. He has since filled many weekends with hackathons, improving his confidence and knowledge, collaborating and networking with hackers around the world, and overcoming many differences to code for a social cause.\n\nAfter five hackathons Jesse felt confident enough to become a mentor, and he loves supporting great teams from around the world. Whether helping fix bugs or teaching new coders the ropes, Jesse enjoys uplifting and motivating other hackers to do their best; being among hackers who want to learn and share their experiences also lets Jesse learn by simply being present. Hackathons have shown him how to motivate his curious nature to improve practical software development and design skills. From front-end design to project marketing, creative freedom in hackathon projects allows him to try novel solutions. Building viable software in a fast-paced environment taught Jesse that how you communicate is just as important as what you communicate, and hackathons gave him a framework to promote safe and collaborative environments in a diverse and inclusive team. The perspectives, skills, and insights Jesse gained from the hacker community help him feel equipped with the right skills to solve problems in a diverse world for a variety of communities.\n\nJesse tends to focus his hackathon projects around serving a positive social cause, and his favorite was \u201cTeach 4A Cause,\u201d which won \u201cBest Social Good Hack\u201d at Hack Your Portfolio by MLH. Jesse loves to teach others and deepen their understanding of new skills, whether as a peer tutor, a violin teacher, a karate sensei, or a hacker, and he is also passionate about raising money for charity, having hosted a charity event with his co-founded strings orchestra for victims of wildfires. Teach 4A Cause unified such drives to support students\u2019 need for online resources to get through virtual semesters, serving as a platform where users can teach courses in any field to raise money for a charity of their choice. Working with several beginner hackers and teammates across different time zones, Jesse sketched out an entity relationship diagram, facilitated communication between members, taught beginners how to leverage GitHub for collaborative coding of the frontend, wrote a template for the backend server, set up a React app, and more. Jesse wrote 16,000 lines of code in 48 hours, an exhilarating, exhausting, and extremely rewarding experience. He recalls his heart racing with excitement during his project\u2019s demo, and when the project won \u201cBest Social Good Hack\u201d he could feel his team cheering through the computer screen. This project embodied his love of hackathons, collaborating with a small team to turn big ideas into reality, and tackling real-world problems to have a positive impact on communities.\n\nThe skills Jesse learned at hackathons allow him to design and develop apps for his own communities and to help disadvantaged communities. Before the pandemic, Jesse enjoyed refining his skills in activities such as pursuing a black belt in karate and leading his orchestra as first violinist. Now, Jesse combines these passions with his discovered love of hacking to engage with and give back to such communities, creating apps to help others continue these activities remotely. Jesse developed \u201cMelodies\u201d to provide a tuner, metronome, and songbook for his 40-member strings orchestra, and made \u201cSpar Sensei\u201d for karatekas to practice with augmented reality. As Jesse comes from a disadvantaged background, he is also passionate about using his skills to aid others from unfortunate circumstances and contribute to their communities. Jesse has made apps such as \u201cWalk of Privilege,\u201d a self-reflecting tool to discover and learn about biases, and \u201cTaxavader,\u201d a web tool that estimates taxes for those who cannot afford an accountant to save them money upfront and prevent unintentional penalties.\n\nAlthough Jesse is a member of many communities, he found the greatest sense of belonging among hackers at hackathons. This community helped him realize how much he has left to learn and sparks his desire to pursue such interests further and deeper. In his first year at university, he started conducting research with several professors, examining and building multi-core hardware processors to create innovative and efficient technology. He intends to apply academic research findings in hackathons and to use hackathon skills in his academic journey.",

    "about": "Noah made an unexpected entrance to the hacker community during his tenure leading the Google Developer Student Club at the University of Windsor when several team members came to him asking to host a hackathon. Having never attended a hackathon, he was intrigued but unsure of how to start the process, so he spent a night learning about what hackathons are, and found himself excited about the innovative and engaging events that hackathons offer. Noah knew the coordination such an event would require, as he had organized the 2019 Canadian Undergraduate Computer Science Conference at his school, as well as several workshops, demo days, and experiential learning events. Noah formed a strong and diverse team from the University, College, and Windsor-Essex region to host WinHacks, the region\u2019s first-ever post-secondary hackathon, and they were driven to create an amazing event that would attract outsiders to the region.\n\nThen a once-in-a-century pandemic was thrown into the mix, and Noah was set for an interesting, challenging, and rewarding experience. With two weeks\u2019 notice, the event had to quickly pivot to a completely digital form, so Noah led his team in establishing partnerships with local, national, and global sources to raise over $50,000 for the event. Noah\u2019s 30-member team pulled together an amazing event with 400+ participants who built 77 innovative projects. WinHacks became one of MLH\u2019s first-ever digital hackathons, and Noah\u2019s team helped other hackathons have more seamless transitions to virtual domains, as he shared their work in talks with MLH and a presentation at Hackcon with hopes of empowering others to make an impact in their own communities. His leadership role in WinHacks allowed him to be a hackathon expert at his first ever hackathon, and he gained valuable experience in sponsorships, stakeholder relations, public speaking, logistics management, and organization\u2014skills that helped shape his current and future career, and even landed him an organizer job with the event\u2019s main sponsor, Invest WindsorEssex\n\nHis job started by having Noah repeat the success of WinHacks 2020 in planning a second regional hackathon BorderHacks 2020, where he forged a cross-border partnership with the United States Department of State to connect and inspire Canadian and American students virtually during COVID-19. The event converged academia and industry with governmental support to build a community of hackers and give them tangible opportunities, and organizing the event allowed Noah to further refine his collaborative and organizational skills. He continued paying these experiences forward at the same job, where he provided funding and guidance to the WinHacks 2021 team in a professional capacity.\u00a0 At BorderHacks and WinHacks, he managed to attract influential tech companies in both regions to participate, creating enhanced opportunities for students on both sides of the border. One of these organizations was WaveDirect Telecommunications. WaveDirect contributed significantly to the event through prizing and mentorship and even hired their challenge winner as a co-op student. Later, they hired Noah, as part of their enhanced efforts to collaborate meaningfully with the community, stemming from their participation at BorderHacks.\u00a0 Noah is amazed that hosting hackathons has allowed him to establish a regional legacy and train teams of organizers who will continue to help the events and region grow for many years to come.\n\nNoah and the organizers he has worked with share a vision that prioritizes unity and progress, with the whole Windsor-Essex region working together to build a vibrant tech community as catalyzed through the hackathons. The Windsor-Essex region is an oft-forgotten pocket of Canada that has borders overlapping the United States, and it is commonly not even printed on maps of Canada. Noah vows that they will not be forgotten anymore. By pioneering events in the Windsor-Essex region, Noah\u2019s team created a platform for others to learn new skills, showcase their projects, connect with industry, and lay the groundwork for their professional careers.\n\nIn fact, when asked if there was anything else he wanted to highlight on his profile, Noah took the time to highlight the efforts of his region rather than just himself. He noted that Aislyn Laurent, Denis Nadarevic, and Jeremie Bornais were crucial to the development and success of hackathons in the area, and named Invest WindsorEssex and WEtech Alliance as important organizations in the region who supported the hackathons. Noah sees himself and these collaborators as just part of a regional collective dedicated to community building through hackathons, and he hopes to highlight the entire \u201cWindsorEssex\u201d brand and region as responsible for their collective advancement efforts.\n\nThe opportunity to have an impact on other hackers as an organizer has been an exciting and rewarding experience for Noah.. Hackers from events Noah organized have messaged him to express their gratitude and share exciting updates on their professional development since the event, and each message fills Noah with pride as they are concrete examples of how he has had a positive impact on other hackers as an organizer, and knowing the impact his work has further motivates him to do his best.\n\nAs a computer science graduate, Noah is aware of the perception of computer scientists as technically literate but socially awkward; however, hackathon organizing and tech community building has helped him turn into \u201ca computer geek with the gift of gab.\u201d His strong technical knowledge coupled with the interpersonal skills developed through the hacker community allows him to relate to and work with people of any background. Noah organized WinHacks and BorderHacks while working several part-time contractor jobs and attending school full-time to pursue a demanding academic degree. School\u2019s focus on academics rather than applications did not resonate with Noah, and if he had not been involved in hackathon organization then he may have lost all motivation to go to class, do his assignments, or even finish his degree. Instead, his involvement with the local community and the opportunity to develop its tech ecosystem not only added value to his degree, but to his life: he has met people from around the world, made professional connections, and lead teams of innovators and event organizers of the future who will introduce their own positive impacts to their communities. The hacker community has been along with Noah for the ride, pushing him to his limits to create opportunities and events that excite attendees and empower them to achieve greatness. This reciprocal learning molded him into a strong community advocate and organizer rather than just a technologist, something he thought would never happen, and he found the journey immeasurably rewarding and exciting.\n\nDespite organizing two major hackathons, providing strategic advising, and being a judge and mentor at other events, Noah has actually never joined a hackathon as a participant, so he has no projects of his own to deem his favorite. However, he offers hackathon organizing as his favorite project. Watching his team\u2019s efforts be legitimized by MLH\u2019s involvement was an exciting personal victory, and the progress his team made in their region in terms of workforce development and regional development has been rewarding and his favorite byproduct of hackathon organization.",

    "about": "Before beginning her studies at Harvard University, Grace felt lost navigating the seemingly limitless possibilities in STEM as a minority within the engineering community. It wasn\u2019t until she participated in numerous hackathons (many of which were sponsored and hosted by MLH) that she found herself on a track that guided her toward an innovative, fast-paced environment that welcomes and fosters diverse perspectives.\n\nGrace\u2019s favorite project is the guitar learning website, Musitar, which provides individuals without access to a guitar an alternative way to practice and learn the instrument. Through the unique synthesis of LEGOs and Arduino, she designed a compact, portable guitar neck that can be used to have active practicing sessions to learn various chord positions. This project holds importance to Grace, who built the project during the COVID-19 pandemic as an outlet to design, build and have fun. Through Musitar, Grace and her hackathon team could make staying safe at home a meaningful, cooperative experience for others as well.\n\nGrace believes in the importance of others exposing themselves to every accessible option and tool in STEM today for the sake of career growth and self-assessment. Both of Grace\u2019s parents moved to the United States from South Korea, working countless hours to make ends meet. Seeing the hardships they endured as immigrants gave Grace the immense drive to support her parents and community, who have supported her all her life. This led to a majority of her work taking place in the education sector, working each summer to help teach students at her local elementary school in their summer school enrichment program.\n\nA first-generation, low-income student herself, Grace understands the importance and difficulty for younger, underprivileged, minority software developers to gain practical, authentic coding experiences. As a proponent of bringing widespread engagement and support to the Open Source project community, she is consistently seeking ways to enact meaningful change with her skills. She was able to work on Resistbot, an Open Source project which aims to help connect constituents with their U.S. Congressional representative via a simple messaging platform. She wrote various YAML configuration files, connecting Resistbot\u2019s messaging platform deliveries to the contact forms on each US representative\u2019s page. This sounds like a lot, because it was. But, despite the sheer size of the project, Grace felt empowered by the opportunity to contribute her self-taught programming knowledge with the end goal of lasting change.\n\nIt was this same work with Open Source projects that led to Grace\u2019s current position as a Code for America Community Fellow. Here, she has spent months assisting local governments in ensuring the effective address of the service delivery inequities in underserved communities. With the help of her team members, Grace is creating a web-based application platform to provide residents a more accessible and simple application for the City of Fort Collins government\u2019s income-qualified programs.\n\nIn any area, Grace wants to ensure that she is giving back to our communities and uplifting others to take inspiration from the journey that she has taken. She is grateful to have been surrounded by this community that supports inclusion and interconnectivity through MLH hackathons, and she is excited to keep following the path she has chosen.",

    "about": "During her sophomore year of high school, Lavanya enrolled in AP Computer Science A, her first formal CS class in high school. She knew she was prepared, having learned how to code at just 10 years old, but this was an all new opportunity.\n\nHowever, as she walked through the classroom door on the first day, she felt daunted. Out of forty students, a tenth of them were girls. She tried to bridge the gap by reaching out to her male peers, but after constant unwelcoming faces and blunt remarks, she found herself left to her own devices when it came to class projects. A few months later, she heard talk of hackathons. The idea was promising: 24-hour friendly competitions where students came to learn, code, and network alongside their peers. After an inhospitable welcome into tech, she felt the need to see what these promises of community were all about.\n\nIn early 2019, Lavanya took it upon herself to bring a hackathon to her area by co-founding AIHacks: Southern California\u2019s first all-female high school hackathon, with a particular focus on artificial intelligence. The event was a success, hosting 100 students for the inaugural event at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies. The progressive efforts of the hackathon received support from organizations such as Stanford AI4ALL, Pixar Animation Studios, and Major League Hacking. The event has seen exponential growth, impacting the lives of over 500 girls through multiple AIHacks events, and realizing Lavanya\u2019s dream of emphasizing the importance of equity in CS. From the leadership skills that came from this endeavor, she has since been given the opportunity to speak at various events hosted by organizations such as TechTogether, CSforALL, and Hack Club.\n\nThroughout the stretch of hackathons Lavanya has attended, her favorite project that she was able to work on took place at the MLH Summer League\u2019s Hack Girl Summer hackathon. She submitted Sully, a chatbot built with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning through Dialogflow that suggests local businesses to support based on the user\u2019s request and geographical location. At the time of the submission, there was an extreme need to amplify small businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effect on local shops. With Sully, Lavanya created something that was both interactive and easy to use for local customers.\n\nImagining not pursuing hacking seems impossible to Lavanya, but the fact is that it was an option at one point. Despite having years of coding knowledge starting at such a young age, she became unconsciously conditioned to believe that there didn\u2019t exist a place for her at the table. It felt more like a hobby, building robots with her dad at home and learning about Scratch on her PC, but when it came to joining the elementary school robotics club or competing on her high school\u2019s cybersecurity team, she felt like an imposter. The constant societal expectations and stereotypes made her feel as if she didn\u2019t belong among her male peers, even with her vast experience. Finding a community of girls who were equally as passionate about Computer Science showed her that she belonged; she was able to push through and put her skills to use, as she continues to do. With a reclaimed passion for computing thanks to her community, Lavanya is grateful to her younger self for not listening to the self-doubt and pushing herself to bring her where she is today. She intends to learn even more about computing at the University of Southern California, wh double-majoring in Computer Science & Business Administration at the University of Southern California, and she hopes to get involved in artificial intelligence research in the future.",

    "about": "Miguel started his journey to coding on a different path. Drawn to finding solutions to complex problems, Miguel was studying mechanical engineering which led him to two co-op experiences. Working in a co-op taught him a lot about himself and about working as a mechanical engineer. He learned the importance of location in the grand scheme of mechanical engineering, often leaving him in remote locations far away from friends and family. Because mechanical engineering work requires in-person activity, the pandemic left a lot of engineers jobless. Feeling cornered, he looked for a new direction and found himself remembering his passion for problem solving, a huge component of coding, and geography was no issue.\n\nMiguel decided to continue with his mechanical engineering major, but took to coding quickly with the help of his sister. At the time, she was completing a software engineering bootcamp, giving him easy access to this new field of interest. Without being enrolled in the bootcamp, Miguel would complete assignments and projects alongside his sister. The amount of work he put in did not go unnoticed, but he was unable to join the camp due to timing. So Miguel started researching other places he could learn and level up his software engineering skills, which is how he discovered MLH. He was accepted into the MLH Fellowship, where he could finally put all of self-taught knowledge to use among a group of peers.\n\nAs a mechanical engineer, Miguel would prefer to keep his studies to himself, traveling to the campus only when necessary for tests and assignments. Now, with his mind set on software engineering, he was excited to be present every day for the Fellowship in any way that he could. He felt that he knew what he was getting into, but the program went above and beyond his expectations. Everybody in his pod was friendly, especially his leader and mentor. Because Miguel had done so much work by himself, it was tough at first to bring himself to ask questions for fear of holding back his team. But, thanks to his mentor, he quickly learned the importance of asking questions and messing up in order for projects to later thrive.\n\nWith some of his podmates, Miguel built ClipBit. The project began with the idea to take any given video and use speech detection technology to extract the audio to make a text file. But, they later discovered that YouTube already had a caption feature built in. Part of the lesson that his mentor pushed on Miguel was the ability to adapt to what may appear to be mistakes. Just because the idea had been forced to change did not mean that the project was a failure, but an opportunity to improve on the original idea. The team took the captions from YouTube and connected it with a Machine Learning (ML) summarizer to summarize what the video was about. Miguel now had tangible results thanks to the fellowship, allowing him to solve problems in a team-oriented way.\u00a0 He took this team building experience with him to the MLH Orientation Hackathon, his very first hackathon. He programmed with a team for the first time, and spoke in depth with other software engineers. The whole experience was eye-opening, and he can\u2019t wait to take what he\u2019s learned from the hackathon to his workplace.\n\nLike many of us, Miguel didn\u2019t enjoy job applications \u2014 they felt like a drag as he searched through the oil and gas industries for mechanical engineering positions. But thanks to his discovery of software engineering, Miguel finds that he\u2019s truly interested and engaged while perusing the job market. He has finally found his niche, one that has and will always keep him intrigued. He makes it a point to apply to companies that he supports or that have products worth getting behind. He found a message to believe in with Housecall Pro, a home service software company. His experience in the MLH Fellowship led to them offering him a job directly following his graduation from the program.\n\nMiguel\u2019s journey has been a non-traditional one, but it\u2019s the experiences he\u2019s gained from his unconventional path that have helped him become the self-starter and team player that he is. His mechanical engineering background challenged him to look further so he landed on software engineering. Diving into the coding world in the middle of a pandemic was undoubtedly a strange time to begin, but it gave Miguel the comfort and satisfaction of bettering himself and finding his passion in a time when he could have remained dormant.",

    "about": "Vincent was interested in technology growing up, yet didn\u2019t have access to many resources until he got his first computer at 15. As soon as he got the PC, he started looking for opportunities to use it and soon found the Community Ambassador Program to aid him in his tech interests. One ambassador Vincent was working with attended her first hackathon and recommended Vincent to try one as he might enjoy it. He had no prior coding experience when he signed up for his first hackathon, StuyHacks 2016, but he decided to give it a shot. Vincent took a train two hours into New York City by himself to attend the event, and even though he doesn\u2019t remember sleeping during the two-day event, he had a blast spending many hours learning to code and networking with others who were also interested in tech.\n\nThis was the start of Vincent\u2019s hackathon spree, and his senior year in high school he spent almost every weekend traveling the east coast for hackathons. He attended over 20 events in a few months in locations ranging from DC to Boston to Michigan. His mom was extremely concerned about how much time he spent traveling, but Vincent assuaged her fears by saying that he had a phone and knew how to get home.\n\nWith his amazing experiences in the hacker community, Vincent is eager to give back as an event organizer. He hosted a high school club for two years that helped students with their personal project developments and gathered students to travel and participate in hackathons. The club hosted a Local Hack Day event, MLH Localhost workshops, and information sessions, and Vincent even partnered with several universities while in high school to advise and help them run events, such as DragonHacks at Drexel University and LFGHacks at Lehigh University. All of the effort Vincent puts back into the community is worth it, as he loves to see students get excited about turning their ideas into real functioning products.\n\nAfter easing into classes at university, Vincent kept up his pace by attending hackathons every weekend, taking buses, trains, or planes, and calling organizers to try and secure guaranteed housing. He was in LA for HackTech when COVID restrictions shook the US. The event was on the verge of cancellation, but he turned the situation around by sharing an Airbnb with 12 other hackers, which they dubbed the HackerHouse, and competing digitally over the weekend. Vincent worked on a hardware hack that involved physically building and printing things, so he had to run the MVP and parts between HackerHouse and a hotel his teammates were staying at, but they came out of the event with a great hack that is now pending a patent.\n\nVincent made one of his favorite hackathon projects at Hack the Crisis Australia. The hack was a queuing application that makes staying socially distant while shopping easier for people. Individuals can scan a QR code to quickly and easily join a host\u2019s queue for entering their store, and the individual will receive a notification when it is their turn to safely enter the store. The project is currently under a pending patent, and Vincent is excited for the hack to be used by businesses for their spaces.\n\nIt was weird for Vincent to reckon with, but he believes that hackathons have had a bigger impact on his life and taught him more than university. While school taught him SQL, Java, and some web development, hackathons gave him practical skills and a network that he can consult to orient his future career. He learned a wide variety of languages and interfaces from the ground up through trial and error: starting with web development, then NodeJS, VueJS and ReactJS, REST API, now using Python, AWS, and GCP, and looking forward to learning ML and AI. Hackathons have also allowed him to overcome his fears by practicing and improving his public speaking and presentation skills. Going to events such as MakeHarvard, HackMIT, and HackWashington and seeing students from Ivy League schools use the same tools at the same pace as Vincent showed him how great of an equalizer hackathons are, but also made him question the value of going to university for programming.\n\nVincent started attending hackathons with no prior coding experience or knowledge of what the field had to offer, and now he finds himself on the verge of attending his 100th event. He has been able to travel all over the world to participate in events and network with people he would have never met otherwise. He expanded on his personal projects at hackathons and even further developed hacks into projects with pending patents. He has made some of his closest friends along the way and looks forward to continuing to attend more events in the coming years (and maybe even hit 200 events).",

    "about": "By the time she was in high school, Katherine knew that she wanted to pursue a career in tech. She also knew, based on experience, that many other women just like her had similar aspirations, a wide pool of potential to work with. So when a teacher said, \u201cThe field of technology is war. Women are not strong enough to face this,\u201d Katherine took it upon herself to prove him wrong. Here, she was faced head on by an individual leveraging their status to reinforce stereotypes that Katherine has fought since that day. The importance of creating positive learning spaces for women in tech continues to be at the forefront of her mind as she takes on whatever challenge the field throws at her.\n\nKatherine\u2019s first move to combat gender discrimination in her area was to create a hackathon, a coding event to inspire young women like her to pursue computer science. And so as a high school junior, Katherine created Hack Like A Girl. You would think that someone with the initiative to start a hackathon would have been to at least one hackathon event previously, but Katherine set up Hack Like A Girl without having ever been to one. There was a need in her area, and that was enough for her to take on such a venture. Once she set her mind to it, she didn\u2019t let herself back down. The event was a huge success, hosted at a local tech company where more women than Katherine could have imagined found a place for themselves. Teaching coding workshops to these passionate innovators was enough to prove to all attendees, including herself, that all of them could succeed in technology.\n\nA hackathon veteran at this point, Katherine appreciates participating in a hackathon without having the added pressure of planning the entire event. One such instance was TreeHacks, where she and her partner Kelly created the Equitas app. It was both of their first times working on an iOS application, but the challenge was welcome and rewarding. The purpose of Equitas is to further promote the necessity of healthcare equality by leading users to free of insurance-covered STD testing centers for stress-free appointments. Katherine poured a lot of herself into this project that she felt so strongly about, in the hopes of saving lives and preserving the sexual health of all.\n\nDuring her freshman year of college, similarly to how she approached her first go at starting a hackathon, Katherine dove into the MLH hackathon scene by herself. She traveled California hoping to create impactful software and to inspire other passionate hackers she met during her trips. The aspect of collaboration with students with entirely different ranges of lived experiences kept Katherine wanting more. Her peers taught her how to develop software solutions for the world, and also interpersonal solutions for remaining confident about her technology skills. At this point, she had more than proven herself, but it\u2019s hard to avoid a dip in self-confidence every once in a while, especially because she was often discouraged by the discriminatory experiences she faced in high school that led her to believe that she wouldn\u2019t have a place in technology. Thanks to her initiative with MLH, however, Katherine now had a community that accepted and uplifted her.\n\nWith a plethora of useful learned technologies under her belt, Katherine isn\u2019t afraid to take on a new type of tech. One of the many valuable skills she\u2019s picked up that she cites is learning how to learn. This is in large part due to the accepting community. Her dedication to attending hackathons alone without a safety net has allowed her to gain collaboration skills and work with all types of people that, ultimately, just want to help each other out. As the president of HackSC, Katherine knows how to lead, manage, and inspire a team in order to create a memorable and unforgettable hacker experience. HackSC began as nothing and became one of the top hackathons in the nation, with events that not only inspired hacker innovation but also gave hackers the opportunity to have fun, a crucial element to Katherine\u2019s experience. Coming into the HackSC experience as a freshman organizer, Katherine really admired the e-board members. So when she became lead of Hacker Experience and a board member as a sophomore, it was a shock to hear that fellow hackers felt their voices were going unheard by the e-board.. Katherine took it upon herself to confront the team and propose a shift in the culture of HackSC, one that would create an inclusive space for hackers and organizers. She continued to face problems such as this when she took on the position of HR Head. This positive energy was an infectious change for the club.\n\nFor those attendees that saw Katherine\u2019s origins of leading a hackathon with no prior event experience, the fact that she continues to inspire inclusion in the hacker community is no surprise. Every experience of hers has been compiled and compounded for the sake of positive internal change among her community. Her mission is to ensure that everyone feels safe, encouraged, and capable of participating in a hackathon, just as she wishes she could have been made to feel from the very beginning. This mission has only been strengthened, and the results speak for themselves.",

    "about": "Rashika comes from a technical background, as her mother works in engineering. When Rashika was younger she used to frequently visit her mom\u2019s office, where she found hanging out in the lab fascinating. Spending time in that space with her mother planted the seed in her mind that she wanted to pursue technology. At the time, she was really into video games and had an idea of becoming a game developer. At the age of 15, she started to learn game development, teaching herself skills through many online tutorials and finding help from her mother's colleague, who became a sort of mentor. In the process of building games, she realized that she didn\u2019t like working on animations but actually loved the logical aspects of coding, an epiphany that helped her realize her passion for computing.\n\nAs Rashika went on to study computer engineering at university, she went from classrooms with equal gender representation to being one of only seven girls in her lecture hall. Gendered stereotypes were a serious challenge for Rashika, as she felt constantly reminded that tech was a field for men, which initially made her feel uncomfortable about pursuing technology. On top of that, the gaps in technical knowledge and enthusiasm that the boys had over the girls made her feel extremely overwhelmed and like an imposter that did not belong there. Male friends in the class were supportive in helping her adjust to the setting, but the hacker community played a huge role in helping her get past those limiting beliefs from the moment she walked into her first event.\n\nOne of Rashika's friends invited her to be a member on their team at a hackathon, and despite not knowing much about hackathons at the time, she liked the idea of building a project from the ground up in a short amount of time. She was hesitant to sign up and unsure of if she would fit in at the event, but she ended up so glad that she took up her friend\u2019s offer. She attended Yomari Hackathon Fall 2017 as a relative beginner to programming, but in a short amount of time, she was able to get so many things done and contribute to her team\u2019s project that she felt, for the first time, confident in her technical skills. The hacker community is the most inclusive and welcoming community she has ever been a part of which gave her a platform to discover and learn new things. Every hackathon since has helped strengthen her \u201cI can\u201d attitude, and without the support of the hacker community and hackathons\u2019 learning environment, Rashika would not be where she is today. She knows that there are a lot of women out in the tech field who are in the same place that she was, and she hopes that her story will inspire and motivate them to take the jump and challenge existing stereotypes by breaking into the world of technology and innovation.\n\nHackathons became a place for Rashika to try out new things and brush up on her skills. Every hack she built made her feel more confident about her technical abilities, which she had previously really struggled with, and everyone she has met and networked with taught her a lot and became valuable and meaningful parts of her social web. Attending hackathons inspired Rashika to help organize several local hackathons, including acting as head of operations for KU Hackfest, Nepal\u2019s first virtual MLH hackathon. The event was inspired by a desire to establish a culture of remote hackathons in Nepal, as many annual in-person events were getting canceled due to COVID-19. Rashika and her team were excited to host a virtual event as they would be able to reach more people outside the university from surrounding communities to make the event more inclusive, but they were also nervous about how to ensure hackers would have the best hackathon experience possible in a virtual format. The planning process involved a lot of meetings with MLH team members and hackathon organizers, especially with Harshil Agrawal, to develop ideas on how to host the virtual hackathon. Based on many suggestions, Rashika's team was able to change much of the hackathon's structure for the virtual event, such as organizing different events to keep hackers busy and let them meet other attendees, making virtual team building events to help hackers network, and the tricky task of using discord bots to try and streamline the process of connecting hackers to form teams. The hard work paid off as the event was a grand success, with over 700 attendees and a ton of positive feedback on their efforts to make the virtual event feel just as inviting and as positive a space as an in-person event. Organizing has taught Rashika leadership and professional skills that will remain valuable for the rest of her life.\n\nRashika had always wanted to get into the world of open source because she loved the idea of collaboratively building projects that add value to the world, but she struggled to get her foot in the door. She found the large codebases of open-source projects intimidating and had no idea where to start. In the process of looking for resources online to get started with open-source contributions, Rashika learned about the MLH Fellowship program. Spending a summer immersing in and contributing to open-source projects was an exciting prospect and exactly what she was looking for, so she applied and was luckily accepted! Rashika created her favorite project at the MLH Fellowship\u2019s orientation hackathon, CodeVid Live, a mobile application that lets users estimate the probability of coronavirus contamination if they stay in a particular area. Before the Fellowship she would usually stick with the same team and work with her go-to tech stack, but collaborating on CodeVid Live with people outside of her time zone while using an unfamiliar tech stack got her comfortable collaborating with people she had not worked with before, and she came out of the orientation feeling confident to try new things and discover new technologies. That summer was an amazing learning experience, and despite a difficult start with open source, her amazing mentor and pod mates helped her make a number of contributions in open-source projects and connect with many amazing Fellows. After the Fellowship, Rashika returned to MLH as a pod leader where she helped other Fellows have the same amazing experience that she did. The entire journey from being a Fellow to a pod leader was super fun and informative for her and helped her get the skills she needed to break into open source development.",

    "about": "TJ found their passion for tech at the age of 8 when they were on YouTube following a tutorial action script (FlashPlayer) and it showed them how to turn a cursor in a flash game into anything. They decided to turn theirs into their initials. What started out small grew into a lifelong passion.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2014 that TJ found the hacker community thanks to Facebook, where they joined two groups: Hackathon Hackers and HS Hackers. Similarly to TJ, these groups were also just getting their start, composed of a relatively small usership.\n\nEven then, TJ was ahead of the curve, HS Hackers, as the name implies, was a group for high school hackers once limited to attendees of PennApps, then widened to anyone in high school. TJ, however, found a way to be admitted as a middle schooler, where they met lots of great friends that they still hold dear to this day.\n\nThese groups gave TJ a sense of self-confidence and support, a rare find in most online communities. With the help of other members, they were able to comfortably ask for feedback and accept constructive criticism. Beyond the positive social ramifications of joining these communities, they\u2019ve also led TJ to events that have changed their life just as much.\n\nTJ went to a good high school, but it was not known for having a great CS program. During their time there, they started the robotics team during their sophomore year and helped them with their branding and social media presence. Wanting to continue to create the community they wish was present, TJ also created the computer science club. As a hacker who had found resources outside of the school, they wanted to give back.\n\nIt was through their work with the computer science teacher, Mr. O\u2019Neill, that TJ\u2019s work had a significant impact. TJ was a teacher\u2019s assistant during their senior year and helped to write code to help organize and manage all of the 3D printing jobs handed in by the students. Over a couple of weeks, they had written a prototype using Node.js. The school started using it and it was put up on GitHub.\n\nA year later, they were contacted by MakerBot, the company that made the 3D printers TJ\u2019s school used. They said that they had seen their project and wanted to discuss working with them. After interviewing with them, TJ was given an offer. Prior to this, TJ had been debating whether a traditional university education was the right path for them and had been applying to jobs. Upon receiving the offer and with the support of their dad, TJ decided to move to New York City and work for them. During their year at MakerBot, TJ worked on internal login systems and the company\u2019s web properties, Thingiverse and MakerBot Cloud. TJ now works at Twosense as a software engineer.\n\nIn recent years, TJ\u2019s attendance at hackathons has been as a mentor, but it didn\u2019t start out that way. TJ got their start by participating in multiple hackathons, one of which brought to life their favorite project, HearTempo \u2014 an app that read the heart rate monitored by one\u2019s watch and changed the BPM of any song in real-time to regulate one\u2019s heart rate.\n\nIt began with the help of a friend who had recently interned at NIH, where he researched Laser Doppler Flowmetry. After a bit of filling in, TJ was left inspired by the knowledge that the BPM of any song can change your heart rate. Using TJ's new Android Wear watch, the team was able to do some practical experimenting.\n\nCodeDay was another event that has left a lasting impression on TJ ever since it entered their radar in 2014. Admittedly, their first CodeDay was a bit lackluster after getting sick halfway through. But TJ\u2019s work was still recognized by the regional manager of the event, who reached out and asked if they\u2019d like to organize the next one. TJ\u2019s been involved with CodeDay ever since where they\u2019ve run the gamut of positions, including being inducted as a board member.\n\nEvery new position has granted TJ a new perspective \u2014 as an attendee, they\u2019ve learned new technical skills that they\u2019re able to implement in their career as a software engineer; as an organizer, they learned how to work better in a team setting while actively engaging with complex logistical problems and as a mentor, they narrowed their scope to individual attendees in need of the same help that they once needed through pair programming, a common practice in TJ\u2019s field.\n\nIt\u2019s also where TJ learned the importance of being an organizer. At CodeDay, they\u2019re able to inspire students that may not have had the resources available to break into computer science and inspire more careers in the industry. It\u2019s important to TJ that they replicate the supportive, beginner-friendly environment they experienced when they joined that very first Facebook group as a kid, which means truly believing that there are no wrong questions and ensuring that CodeDay fosters healthy competition that you may not find in your typical hackathon.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly gratifying for TJ to feel like they\u2019re reciprocating the inclusive environment that they\u2019ve spent years receiving from their peers. Hearing that an attendee feels supported enough by CodeDay to pursue a career in the field of computer science is the most fulfilling part for TJ\n\nTJ credits their success today to their community for fostering their passion at such a young age. Without them, TJ wouldn\u2019t have been pushed to learn by participating without the fear of being judged.\n\nAfter a long-standing history with CodeDay, TJ was given an internship with the group, opening up the floor for tons of practical experience with projects and after years of dedicated work, MakerBot, a company in the 3D printing space, noticed their hard work. They landed a position with the organization straight out of high school as a software engineer \u2014 a testament to the impact of the hacker community, which TJ will never take for granted.",

    "linkedin": "",
    "website": "",
    "about": "When Will began his time at university, he was still searching for his niche. He knew enough about his interests to quickly immerse himself in the school\u2019s computing society. After some talk about a local hackathon, Will decided to get involved. He didn\u2019t know what a hackathon was or what it entailed, but he knew that he wanted to be as involved as he could be and meet other people. So he and some friends formed a team and got to work. The idea was an Android app designed to help students make use of food ingredients before spoiling in order to reduce waste. A great idea, but Will\u2019s team had bitten off more than they could chew. Paired with faulty UI and time constraints, the team was left with an incomplete project, but a memorable experience. They had all worked their hardest, which the judges saw enough to give them the Best Newbie Prize. This new experience and motivation made it clear to Will that he had found something to work toward.\n\nA fast learner, Will bounced from hackathon to hackathon, practically planning itineraries for future events while coding at another. Thanks to the experience of his friends and teammates, Will got hands-on experience with git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At one event, he used this knowledge to build a Nintendo Switch JoyCon musical instrument with a web browser. Having his first failure under his belt, Will was entirely comfortable with making his next project fun while learning from his experience. The demo impressed users and judges enough to leave with first place. Will was on his way out the door, prize in hand, thinking about the next event.\n\nOf all the strange projects Will has been happy enough to work on, Willmojis stands out as a lifelong memory. The plan was to create actual TrueType emoji fonts from just photos of someone\u2019s face. So, the plan became a reality. The combination of image manipulation, facial recognition, and a stockpile of Will selfies left the team with a project that worked according to plan. It barely held itself together, but that\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s such an important event to Will.\n\nLiving with a chronic illness left Will nervous about travelling frequently and meeting new people when he was younger. But after meeting so many caring and understanding people at hackathons, he felt more welcomed and comfortable than he could have imagined. Memories of staying up all night just chatting with teammates in hotels are the memories that keep him coming back event after event. Because of the few widespread hacking events across the UK, Will took it upon himself to work with HackTheMidlands 4.0, allowing him to speak with multiple schools and present his own accomplishments created through hackathons. Seeing students become inspired by his own words made Will sure that he was doing the right thing, and wanted to take his work one step further in order to make technology accessible for all. He looked into volunteering, a way to build one\u2019s organizing skills in order to assist a hackathon run smoothly, without the months of prep. One volunteering job led to another, and soon he had worked eight events as a volunteer. Having seen so much of the inner workings of event planning, Will had the inkling of an idea to build his own event with the help of his friends.\n\nTeam building, project management, and task prioritization are just a few of the skills that Will can confidently say he possesses after his experiences at hackathons. There are some things that just aren\u2019t taught in school, and these skills are just some of the few that came to Will thanks to the specific environment of competitive hacking. It wasn\u2019t until the medium went all virtual that Will realized just how valuable these skills are. Born from the boredom and stir-craziness of being on lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, Will and his friends (including Jacklyn Biggin) began organizing Hack Quarantine. The idea was to create a space where hackers could meet and greet during a time when everyone was holding their breath. As the planning process got going, the array of collaborative and problem-solving skills that he had learned became very clear. Will, when faced with a planning problem, never quickly accepted defeat but instead asked himself how he could use what he\u2019s learned to form a solution. And more often than not, he had that solution. The event brought in over 3,500 active people, a true shock to Will and the team. It\u2019s easy to see how far he has come, from hopping school to school in hopes to empower one student to the larger success of Hack Quarantine, but Will views every connection made with just as much importance.\n\nAfter Hack Quarantine, Will and a friend decided to build Hack Productions, a livestream company to help more organizations make the transition to digital events. They saw a current necessity in the market due to unforeseen circumstances, adapted, and brought their adaptation to others for the sake of helping whoever may need it. They were given the opportunity to work with hackathons that had gone digital all over the world in order to bring quality entertainment and engaging events to thousands of hackers in all. Seeing that they were bringing memorable experiences at a time when people needed them was incredibly empowering for Will.\n\nAs an organizer and volunteer, Will cannot understate the importance of the soft skills he has learned. Because tech is so fast-paced and filled with professional jargon, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the hard skills and overlook the soft, but when it comes to planning an event where many different people and communities bring their skills, the soft skills are invaluable. A few years ago, Will wouldn\u2019t have said confidently that he was a strong writer or public speaker. Now, he doesn\u2019t have to say it because the results speak for themselves. He\u2019s been in the community for over two years, from a competitor to a volunteer to an organizer, bringing in other attendees and encouraging anybody along the way to get involved the same way that he was encouraged to get involved. Knowing that he has been able to bring any sort of impact on other hopeful hacker\u2019s lives is what drives Will to continue going above and beyond in his community.\n\nLast summer, Will started helping out with the MLH Fellowship as an intern, helping hundreds of people have the best experiences possible. He hosted a variety of talks and sessions for the fellows to help gear them up for their careers. After a fun summer, Will was interested in staying involved somehow as he found the Fellowship incredibly empowering. He quickly transitioned to a part-time role helping run the day-to-day experience for fellows while completing the final year of his degree. After building the fellowship over the last year, Will transitioned to working full-time on the program and curriculum. This was incredibly rewarding for Will as he was able to continue giving back to the community in a much larger capacity than before.",

    "website": "",
    "about": "Ayaan first heard about hackathons as a freshman in high school, when a friend told him about a coding competition where she stayed at a convention center overnight and built a cool computer science project. Ayaan had little app or web development knowledge, so he spent a few months learning Swift to prepare for a hackathon. He eventually signed up for Omnihacks and was hyped to experience a hackathon firsthand. He and his friends packed sleeping bags and brought snacks (just in case), then took a train to the event. The theme was Healthcare, so they decided to create an IOS app that let blind patients read prescriptions with an OCR. The app became Tickbird, named after the bird species that help rhinos traverse the world, and it not only received a top 10 award and 2nd best mobile app, but they were able to get the app approved for the App Store after some structural changes. The entire experience was a blast, as they goofed around for much of the first day, attended great machine learning workshops, and hoarded whatever snacks and food they could find. That weekend was the beginning of Ayaan's Hackathon career, and now, a year and a half later, he is a seasoned veteran who is so glad he jumped into his first hackathon despite not even really knowing what it was.\n\nHackathons are an extremely significant part of Ayaan\u2019s life throughout high school, not only building his talents and helping him shape a future career in computer science, but also proving critical in improving his friendships and philosophy on teamwork. Ayaan joined the hackathon community with a different team than he works with now, starting with a high school friend he wasn\u2019t close to but who shared his interest in app development. His friend was talented and had more coding experience than Ayaan, and they formed a great partnership where Ayaan learned and improved his skills. As his skills increased, Ayaan and the friend drifted apart, so he decided to share his passion for hackathons with his group of best friends that had no hackathon experience (shoutout Viraaj, Adithya, Ishaan, and Sajiv). It was up to Ayaan to teach the group, and once he realized that leading was his role, he embraced the fact that his own success could only be defined by the group\u2019s success. This mentality shift was a turning point, and after one event they started winning hackathon after hackathon through the rest of the summer. Those 4 months of back-to-back events helped Ayaan strengthen valuable friendships and improve his mentality by teaching him the importance of communication and trust, and they hope to have the same fun experiences this summer.\n\nAyaan has worked extensively on giving back to the hackathon community as a mentor and fellow hacker. Aspiring coders around the world, from India to Seattle to Ohio, have reached out to him asking for tips and help, and he remains in touch with them to this day. In his local community, he helps students at his school with advice on project management skills such as time management, project ideation, and coding itself. Ayaan also teaches computer science and other STEM concepts in a variety of places, such as robotics at the local YMCA, an AI class for the city, and (his favorite) a robotics and STEM program called Jaago Robotics at the Jaago School in Bangladesh, his home country.\n\nEncouraged by his mentees\u2019 inquisitiveness, Ayaan and his team started a personal club for hackathon enthusiasts to mentor anyone interested during their free weekends. The club has been very successful, teaching multiple students to become successful hackers and driven individuals who will assume leadership positions to hopefully keep the club alive, training hackers for many years to come. Their team found a way to make a strong impact in their local community through mentorship, and by promoting hackathons to many students, Ayaan hopes that others will make the same great memories at hackathons that he had.\n\nAs of now, Ayaan wants to pursue academic AI research at institutes such as Google AI or DeepMind Labs, or in a university setting. Hackathons have given him the skills he needs to pursue lab-based research when he goes to university. He has spent many weeks developing hard skills in software engineering through AI-based projects, learning the inner workings of AI frameworks PyTorch and Keras, and growing his understanding of high-level theory; however, hackathons have also helped Ayaan develop his soft skills. Conducting AI research involves creating large-scale AI solutions under strict deadlines and pressure, skills Ayaan developed from hackathons and the hacker community, as building functional and innovative projects in 1-2 days taught him to be efficient and focused. Both domains also involve working well with small teams and having constant communication and smart division of labor amongst themselves. Failures and mistakes are also inevitably present, and hackathons have allowed him to make mistakes and get better at recovering from them. Preventing failure can involve reconstructing miswritten code or retraining a model with flawed parameters, yet it always involves precision and attention to detail, skills imperative to running proper experiments and creating reproducible code. Most importantly, however, Hackathons have helped Ayaan develop a creative and innovative mind, forcing him to formulate projects novel to the field, as uniqueness is important to event judges. The ideas need to be real solutions that are helpful to people and improve upon current standards. In AI research, each published paper presents a new method of achieving a task that improves on past work, so Ayaan\u2019s experience in finding novel solutions to present issues will hopefully help him become a great AI researcher in his future career.\n\nAyaan\u2019s favorite hackathon project is SuiSense, a web application that uses AI to distinguish between suicidal and depressive messages, using NLP deep neural networks that perform classification between suicide and depression in text format using data from Reddit. The project began at Same Home Different Hacks in June 2020, where they received an honorable mention, but it has since been refined into a real application that can have a large impact on people\u2019s lives. Inspired by the story of Alexandra Valores, a girl who lost her life to suicide, Ayaan\u2019s team spent every day for two months after the hackathon working to improve the algorithm and implement new features, and 500 commits later, they had a great final product. They wrote an article about the app which quickly caught traction, and reached out to therapists in the Bay Area as well as mental health support groups at his school to get professional input. Such interactions were a great opportunity for them, allowing them to share their work with potential users and learn how to optimize the application for real-world impact. Their efforts earned them 4th place at the Congressional App Challenge, and they are now working to implement SuiSense in their school and other local organizations. You can watch a video demo of SuiSense here.\n\nAfter attending a number of hackathons and immersing himself in the hacker community, Ayaan realized that some hackathon attendees are more focused on winning prizes rather than uplifting the community or the many professional and social benefits of attending. While Ayaan has found great success as a hacker, it is even more important for him to help other hackers have positive experiences and achieve the same success that he has. In talking with hackers, he has seen their eagerness to learn and grow from the mentorship of experienced hackers like himself.\u00a0 Many students who attend hackathons enter as skilled coders with strong tech backgrounds, but because Ayaan started with no such background and learned everything through the community, he relates to and eagerly helps those who started like he did because they are the foundation and structure of the community. This path allows Ayaan to continue to grow and build the hacker community even while just being in high school, showing that there is support for people outside of STEM to freely and comfortably learn to become a hacker.\n\nFinally, Ayaan would like to again shout out his teammates, Viraaj, Adithya, Ishaan, and Sajiv for being great friends who have supported him over the last year and made hacking a very enjoyable experience.",

    "about": "A large part of Gabriel\u2019s introduction to coding was due to his bond with his older brother. They would watch each other play video games while passing the controller back and forth and quickly back again to his brother, who did the majority of the playing. Gabriel loved watching, and when his brother wanted to play a game that involved building a whole setup, he learned the basics of building computers and running servers. He never thought that he had it in him, but his admiration of his brother drove him to use what he learned by simply being there. His brother eventually became a software engineer, which Gabriel continued to learn from. Their shared growth alongside each other has been a huge part of where Gabriel is today.\n\nIt took a while for Gabriel to get going with a group that he cared about, but he finally landed on Ganesh in 2018. Ganesh was a security group, Gabriel\u2019s first introduction to cybersecurity. Using the years of knowledge he had from growing up with his brother, he took on a leadership position fairly quickly. Admittedly, he didn\u2019t know a lot about cybersecurity, but he did know a lot about computers. He saw a leadership opportunity and took it, teaching the basics of computer dashboards to the first-year students of the group, while studying cybersecurity on the side to ensure that he was doing the most that he possibly could. He would study every day, teach once or twice a week, and before he knew it, he was more than fit for the position. He became a large part of the club, so when Computer Science Week came along, it was natural that he would be asked to speak. Gabriel couldn\u2019t refuse, and even went a step further, volunteering to run a workshop on Denial of Service. His emphatic drive to bring information to others was rewarded by a great turnout. The hours of supplementary studying that Gabriel did in order to better himself and help others left him with the means to work with a lawyer in order to implement data privacy laws for several companies.\n\nIn 2020, Gabriel was given the opportunity to start an exchange program in France. The program was impacted by COVID-19, and he was left with nothing to do but play music. After waiting around in quarantine, a friend messaged him with an opportunity for those familiar with Open Source called the MLH Fellowship. More than familiar, Gabriel applied, with little hopes of acceptance. He had tried multiple programs before, and none of them worked out, but an application and three interviews later, MLH saw Gabriel\u2019s potential and accepted him.\n\nThe Fellowship was an amazing time. Gabriel knew going into it, based on his friend\u2019s advice, that he needed to really focus on it since he was so excited about it. This was no problem for Gabriel, who had proven to himself that he will go above and beyond to educate himself about his passions. Beyond educating himself, he knew now that he loved educating others, and decided to become a Pod Leader with MLH. He thought he had it in him, and with some encouraging words from fellow leaders, he took on the responsibility. His relationship with his mentors encouraged him to bring the utmost sense of understanding to his future leadership positions. The shift to programming studies in college was relatively simple for Gabriel given the years of coding knowledge he had built up. It was seemingly unorthodox to start programming so much later after building such a large framework of coding knowledge, but that inevitably paid off. He was very quickly comfortable in front of a code editor. Among the constant coding grind, Gabriel built a project that he still uses everyday called xcreep, an easy to use, easier to install script that has made life just a little easier for a busy student.\n\nBecause it\u2019s been so long since Gabriel entered the community as an active member, it\u2019s hard for him to say how his time with his peers has changed his life because there are so many points in his life that were directly impacted by his peers. An easier pool of experiences to draw from would be the ways that his life hasn\u2019t been changed by his community since it\u2019s so much smaller of a pool. He\u2019s made lifelong friends, met people from around the world, and seen other countries all thanks to his time in tech. He can compare his day-to-day work to a hackathon: hard deadlines, prioritization, and concentration without comparison. Everyone ends up finding their niche in a hackathon, just like they do in life. Gabriel has found his niche after countless failures. Luckily, he didn\u2019t see his failures as a sign to quit, but as a sign to do the most to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.",

    "about": "Helping others is a passion of Karan\u2019s, whether through community clean-ups as an Eagle Scout or volunteering at the local hospital. In high school, Karan took a number of science courses, hoping to one day become a physician, but this vision shifted when he landed a research position at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. He started learning computer science as he developed visualizations for various biological research projects, and his mentor encouraged him to step outside of his comfort zone and develop a computational background. He suggested that\u00a0 Karan attend his first hackathon, Bitcamp Spring 2017, with just a basic knowledge of Java and Javascript.\n\nWalking into the Xfinity Center and seeing college students with boxes of electronics and monitors was quite intimidating at first. The hackathon began with a keynote speech by Brendan Iribe, founder of Oculus, and Karan learned that they had attended the same high school. Connecting with a billionaire and being inspired by his story of starting college with no programming experience helped Karan quell his nervousness and find the motivation to network with company representatives and attendees. During a Node.js workshop, Karan met and formed a team with three college freshmen, and in no time, ideas were flying, code was written, and a product was developed. They created LifeOK, an application that lets patients share diary entries with their physicians so that they can better understand the patients and provide better health care treatment. Learning how to code, build websites, and work with complete strangers all within 36 hours was an amazing experience, and he is extremely grateful to be able to help other hackers have that same experience in his current role as a hackUMBC organizer.\n\nIt only took a few hackathons for Karan to notice the underrepresentation of minority groups in the community among organizers, sponsors, and hackers. Despite increased diversity in scientific fields in recent years, there is still much work to be done as only 14% of recent computer science majors are from Black/Latinx backgrounds, and only 20% of computer science graduates are female. Karan wants to help fight such disparities in the hackathon community and did so through his work at hackUMBC. Since joining his freshman year, Karan helped raise over $20,000 from newly recruited sponsors, built a judging application with the tech team, and pitched events around campus. Organizing events let him share his own experiences with those from underrepresented backgrounds and draw more diverse attendees, and as Karan took on more responsibilities, he eventually became a director of hackUMBC. As director, his goal was to promote representation and diversity in the tech community, and he did so by partnering with various organizations. Karan is a Meyerhoff Scholar at UMBC, connecting him with an organization dedicated to increasing academic diversity by helping underrepresented populations succeed in science. Last year he worked with the CEO and Founder of Technovation, Tara Chklovski, an international non-profit organization that promotes women to enter the computer science field. With hackUMBC 2020 going virtual, Chklovski promoted the event to Technovation alumni, and the event saw a record high of female attendance at nearly 40%. While there is still much to be accomplished, Karan is doing his best to take steps in the right direction.\n\nAs computer science grows to be a more integral part of everyday life, Karan reminds us that it is important to understand the repercussions it may have on others and our world. Studies show that technology exacerbates many of the inequalities in America, and such inequities have been highlighted by the pandemic as many people are not able to work remotely without easy access to technology. Karan hopes to make technology more available and beneficial for those who most need it, and his local work helping around Baltimore not only excites him about becoming a physician, but has helped him find a way to make a difference. At hackathons, Karan can not only test new technologies or develop fun games, but work on products that will help those around us. Computer science provides a pathway for anyone to become successful regardless of their background with powerful tools at our fingertips, and by organizing hackUMBC events and mentoring at middle- and elementary schools, Karan stays connected to his roots so that he can inspire others to find their own means of impact.\n\nKaran has come a long way since learning his first web application at Bitcamp 2017, and he attributes all of his technical skills to various teammates and mentors at every hackathon he attended. Whether sitting next to Google Cloud sponsors to learn Firebase and Android development at PennApps, learning basic machine learning models like SVMs and Random Forest Algorithms from mentors at HackRU 2019, or having an MLH Coach teach him Twilio\u2019s API, Karan found the help provided at hackathons invaluable in developing his skills. His career trajectory has also taken a drastic turn since 2017, thanks to the hacker community that helped him find a new passion, unlock new opportunities, and help people in unique ways through computer science.\n\nHe currently works in a computational biology research lab at his university, where he develops tools to help predict drug repurposing targets, leading to faster and safer therapeutics. He has even proposed how such work could be used to help solve the COVID-19 pandemic. Karan has presented this work at conferences in San Diego, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles. His efforts led to a nomination as a finalist for the ACM Student Research Competition by Microsoft, and even earned him the prestigious Goldwater Scholarship out of over 5,000 STEM students nominated for the award. Goldwater Scholars are selected based on their contributions and recognitions in research, with many being published authors and having presented research at conferences. Karan will soon be inducted into the prestigious community of previous winners and esteemed professors.\n\nLast summer, Karan interned at Harvard Medical School, using his website development skills to create an interactive visualization tool that calculates and communicates the potential complications of a surgical operation, while collaborating with physicians, data scientists, and researchers. Seeing his creation used to help people in a clinic will always be a dream of his, and hackathons have made it possible for him to have a potentially wide-reaching impact in the field of healthcare. This summer, Karan will be working with the Technology and Translational Research Unit at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, to investigate the impact of the pandemic on trends in substance use, and mental health across the nation through analyzing Qualtrics surveys and social media trends.\n\nKaran\u2019s work in the medical lab also carried over to many projects he developed at hackathons, such as a machine learning algorithm that detects one-sided facial weakness to predict if a patient is experiencing a stroke at Bitcamp 2019, and PictoPill, an AR app that uses NLP to identify important details from a pill\u2019s barcode and help patients schedule prescription drugs at PennApps. He never expected that attending one hackathon could snowball into fluency in many languages and frameworks, winning various research competitions, or an internship at Harvard, and the more he works with new computational technologies, builds projects, and meets new people at hackathons, the closer he comes towards his career goals.\n\nKaran built his favorite hackathon project Hungry Hungry Santa during HolidayHacks 2020. During the pandemic, many local restaurants and businesses were significantly impacted. With many restaurants being forced to shut down, and foodies, such as Karan, missing their food, the idea for Hungry Hungry Santa came to him. Using Google Cloud to train a population prediction algorithm and a Python web-crawler, the web application has two goals: to help people find their favorite food while remaining safe and socially distanced, and to bring cheer to local restaurant owners affected during the pandemic. Building a project at a virtual hackathon was not as exciting as working in person, but seeing a project from idea to something complete that helps spread joy and positivity (and food) is what he loves most about hackathons. Working on the project kept Karan busy during a quarantine-Christmas weekend, and helped him end a rough year on a happy note. Winning second place at the event was only a cherry on top.\n\nKaran plans on matriculating into an MD-PhD program centered around computational biology. As a physician-scientist with an MD-PhD, he will be able to develop novel technologies to be implemented in clinical settings. The medical degree will give him a better grasp on the various problems that lead to healthcare disparities and inaccessible treatments, and the Ph.D. training will help him develop, test, and share computational solutions with the rest of the research community. Hackathons have always been a big part of Karan\u2019s research experience, and they will continue to help him as he achieves his career goals.",

    "about": "Anudit vividly remembers how excited he was as a 9-year-old when visiting his aunt for the summer in Lucknow, India after she bought a cutting-edge desktop PC\u2014an Intel Pentium III decked out with Windows 98, 64 MB of RAM, and a 10 GB hard drive. He fell in love with the machine, and once his aunt got a dial-up internet connection, the scope of his exploration hugely expanded. After several summers Anudit knew that he wanted to pursue technology, so his dad bought him a computer for their home. He went on to ace computer education classes in high school, learn to code, and pursue computer science at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. Anudit filled his time exploring various clubs, projects, and research topics, and was eventually drawn to Open Source programming which he pursued during the Google Summer of Code Program (GSoC). At GSoC, Anudit integrated the Open Supported Data Interface API into CiviCRM to enable interoperability among various other management systems to help lower integration costs and maintain cross-platform data consistency. He worked closely with mentors from around the world, and GSoC not only exposed him to real-life software development that impacts millions of users, but it also helped him hone time-management skills when working with people on opposite sides of the world.\n\nAs a mentor, Anudit believes in building a strong community and in empowering hackers. After GSoC, Anudit was appointed head of his university\u2019s Open Source Learning Club, which involved teaching git and giving free open-source introductory sessions to freshmen students during his weekends. As his classes became more popular, students came from other schools such as Delhi Technological University, IIIT-Delhi, and Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology just to learn from him. The program gave rise to three GSoC admits in 2016, and six the following year. Students who attended his classes went on to make significant contributions at Mozilla, VLC, FOSSASIA, and other notable Open Source organizations. Anudit was amazed at his ability to inspire and teach such a large group of people and help them achieve their dreams, and he feels immensely proud when he gets invited to give guest lectures and mentoring sessions to help more young minds grow at his alma mater.\n\nForming the team Ignited_Minds with other hackers, Anudit attended Smart India Hackathon in Spring 2017, a massive nationwide hackathon under the aegis of their Prime Minister. They made it to the finals of the event, and despite not winning the event, they realized that their team spirit gave them powerful momentum. They carried this momentum into a hackathon winning streak, taking first place at Airtel WHack Hackathon, EY Intelligent Automation Hackathon, and two national-level corporate hackathons. The winning streak even continued abroad, winning the global-level hackathon 5G FWD UltraHack at the University of Oulu in Finland, claiming the Social Media Challenge. Ignited_Minds won numerous other hackathons and coding challenges, and off the wave of these victories they formed the organization StreetHack, a platform that helps institutions hone a culture of collaboration and progressive learning. StreetHack has two tracks that tailor to enterprises and universities: the enterprise track helps companies with product research and development, testing, market research, and engagement with enterprise personnel, while the university track helps hone an educational culture and bridge the gap between academia and industry.\n\nThe hackathon community launched Anudit into the technology sphere, prompting him to pursue a Master\u2019s Degree in Computer Science at California State University Long Beach, and allowing him to find incredible opportunities as a mentor at various MLH North American hackathons. His journey has been unique, meeting awesome hackers, mentors, and organizers who taught him how to not only take a different perspective in technical challenges but also in his everyday life.\n\nOne of Anudit\u2019s favorite winning projects he helped make was a \u201cContract Reader Tool\u201d at EY Hackathon Fall 2017. The event was hosted by one of the big four accounting companies of India and had hackers develop innovative solutions for regulatory- and tax-related problems. The teams were challenged to develop digital prototypes to help simplify dynamic business functions including taxes, law compliance, or supply chains through the use of disruptive technologies, such as robotics process automation, machine learning, natural generation, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Anudit\u2019s team created a hack that used NLP on a dataset of company contracts to perform contract completeness checks, extract relevant clauses, execute applicability checks, and subsequently share the resulting report. The tool also predicted the most likely tax deduction rates at the source applicable to particular transactions by reading keywords from the invoice and mapping them against a programmed rate master. Anudit\u2019s team even got their project covered in an online news article, which was an amazing highlight for him.\n\nIt is easy to look at successful individuals and only see their success or fame, yet that is only the tip of the iceberg. Their journey surely involved thousands of hours put into improving their skills, but even that is just a part of the submerged iceberg. The deepest points of the iceberg are made of endless efforts, late nights, hard work, discipline, rejection, and dedication. Anudit has been on both sides of this iceberg, admiring the tip from above the water, not knowing what lies underneath, and submerged in the water, spending tremendous amounts of effort and focus on making an idea come to life during a hackathon. Whenever he mentors at hackathons, Anudit has a deep sense of respect for hackers who diligently work on their innovative ideas because he knows what it is like to be in that place. When hackers approach him, he makes sure to help them wholeheartedly, going through great lengths to untangle their problems because he wants them to succeed if they truly desire it. Anudit loves giving back to the community that made him who he is today, and by helping others gain useful information and experiences, he hopes to build their icebergs to the point that they can break above the surface and find their own success.\n\nYou can learn more about Anudit on his website here.",

    "about": "Always fascinated by discovery and creation, Manish was naturally drawn to Computer Science. After some time learning the basics of programming, he was eager to join whatever hackathon he could and see what he could create. With this attitude, he was brought to Everest Hack, where he worked as a volunteer.\n\nThe organizers had big goals in mind, and Manish made sure they were met. He participated in the presentation of the benefits of hackathons in order to encourage students from all over to participate in Everest Hack. With volunteers like Manish, Everest Hacks became the largest hackathon ever organized in Nepal at the time. Seeing such a rewarding outcome to the work he put in only fueled him to take his position from hackathon volunteer to hackathon participant at HexCode. Manish and his team built a web app to provide a platform for disaster relief through the organized distribution of materials. The amount of time he had put into learning the appropriate skills, volunteering in order to see how these skills are put to use, and finally implementing those skills for the sake of meaningful creation made Manish certain that this is what he wanted.\n\nThe same thoroughness that Manish brought into his journey of understanding the ins and outs of CS is apparent in all of his projects. His favorite is Smartfarmer, his first venture in digital hackathons with MLH. Learning IOT at the time inspired him to put that knowledge to use by making a smart IOT system for land development. The project won a category prize, putting his first hackathon win under his belt.\n\nThe hacker community, apart from aiding his learning process, gave Manish social skills that he\u2019ll always be grateful for. Even before his time in college, he was a shy guy that preferred keeping to himself and didn\u2019t see much of a reason to change. Public speaking wasn\u2019t just an inconvenience, it was a nightmare. But after learning CS and being introduced to some welcoming tech communities, his outlook was changed entirely. The same shy person was now speaking about the appeal of hackathons to large groups of strangers without breaking a sweat. It no longer felt like a chore, but a true interest to connect with people from all around the world.\n\nManish was able to realize this dream of learning and growing with his community after being selected as a Microsoft Student Partner. Thanks to his community, his responsibilities were nothing he couldn\u2019t handle, organizing workshops, publicly speaking, and participating in weekly tech events. As his experience grew, so did his confidence. He took this confidence as a sign to organize the first ever MLH member event \u201cBernHack 2020\u201d\u00a0 in Nepal. This led to further experiences like speaking at HackCon 2020 and being selected as a GitHub Campus Expert.\n\nHackathons have always had an effect on Manish that encouraged him to take his ideas one step further so that they don\u2019t just remain ideas, but become functional projects. The lessons of time management in the scope of big ideas that come naturally from the beneficial pressure of hackathons have given him confidence and leadership abilities. But greater than his confidence is his gratitude to his community and the connections that he\u2019s built because of it. This growth alongside his peers has led him to the belief in learning and growing together.\n\nNot many hackathons have been organized in Nepal. The long waiting period between events left Manish and his peers eager for any opportunity, so when MLH came to APAC, he immediately applied. Bringing a large international hackathon to Nepal left his team with encouraging feedback from participants, mentors, and judges. The overwhelming positivity has allowed him to usher in the second Nepalese MLH member event as an advisor.\n\nManish is a testament to the fact that time is an essential aspect of growing among the hacker community. It seemed scary at first, but his team-oriented peers made the growth seamless. A massive part of his enjoyment in tech is interacting with his fellow hackers, collecting their interests, and acknowledging their feedback. Looking back and seeing how he has been able to organize events, volunteer, advise, and help in the overall growth of his local community makes him proud of who he is today.",

    "about": "Aditya\u2019s introduction to the world of hackathons was a bit more turbulent than most. His coding journey began in middle school, leading to the study of Computer Science all throughout high school. What was once an intense passion later became an intense case of imposter syndrome \u2014 seeing how others progressed alongside him left him very unmotivated, frequently comparing himself to others. This manifested in Aditya picking up more activities outside of the tech world. It was thanks to the welcoming hacker community that he was able to rediscover that love for coding and get him out of that rut. By shedding the fear of failure or second-hand disappointment, he was able to start fresh while learning from equally eager peers.\n\nDuring his freshman year of college, he worked as an organizer in his department\u2019s tech fest \u2014 Cyber Cup \u2014 which featured a 24-hour hackathon. Given his duties as an organizer, Aditya primarily focused\u00a0 on building partnerships and bringing sponsorship to the event. He helped execute promotional activities and manage the final day on-premises hacker experience.\n\nOverseeing the tech fest in this way was an exhilarating way for Aditya to take a glimpse behind the curtain into the world of hackathons as well as the surrounding tech community ecosystem. The Cyber Cup hackathon saw over 150 hackers join from various parts of India, GitHub Campus Experts, and Microsoft Student Partners \u2014 now Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors. Following this experience, Aditya applied and became a Microsoft Student Partner in September of 2019, which led to an invitation to attend the Microsoft Student Partner meetup at HackCBS. This event happened to host the coinciding launch event of MLH\u2019s APAC League.\n\nIt was here that Aditya took advantage of the opportunity to interact with Microsoft associates as well as MLH\u2019s CEO, Mike Swift. Those whom he spoke with gave him the understanding of the scale that hackathons could achieve as well as the platform they provided.\n\nFollowing this eye-opening event, Aditya hoped to attend more in-person hackathons, a wish that went unfulfilled due to the pandemic. Fortunately, the growing opportunities within the digital hackathon landscape allowed him to pivot seamlessly. Seeing as this was a chance to grow as a hacker, Aditya leveraged the openings given to him and made the most of the event by organizing MLH Local Hack Day and HackOn 1.0, which saw over 2000 registrations.\n\nNow fully immersed in the hacking world, he couldn\u2019t stop there. Aditya went on to act as a speaker and judge of HackJaipur, participate as a first-time hacker at RookieHacks, win the Microsoft VS Code Hackathon, speak at MLH Hackcon VIII and become an MLH Coach. These multitude of experiences acted as milestones in Aditya\u2019s ongoing learning process and are the very reason he shares a passion for hacking with his community.\n\nAditya\u2019s favorite hackathon project is CodeCapture, a web application that aims to facilitate coding education for individuals with limited to no access to computer systems by taking code from paper to mobile. By using the web app, the user simply captures an image of handwritten code from their mobile phones, where it is then extracted to the in-browser editor to then be edited and compiled by the user.\n\nAditya\u2019s journey with CodeCapture and his team members dates back to the Microsoft VS Code Hackathon. It began with different means to an end \u2014 at first, it was a VS Code extension that would extract code from an image and save it in a new file to be checked later. The idea stood ground on its own, resulting in the team\u2019s hackathon victory. Part of the prize involved a mentorship with Amanda Silver, a CVP at Microsoft. It was during their team's discussion with Silver that they brainstormed the implementation of the concept in a real-world setting and the idea of developing the depth of CodeCapture for the upcoming Hour of Code 2020 event. Silver further connected Aditya and his team with Travis Lowdermilk, UX Researcher at Microsoft, and Jacqueline Russell, Program Manager for Microsoft MakeCode.\n\nThanks to the helpful words of Lowdermilk and Russell, Aditya kept in mind the needs of the customer when he and his team set out to create two more versions of CodeCapture, one being a Progressive Web App, and the other a Cross-Platform Mobile App. The Mobile App went on to be featured in the Student Showcase at .NET Conf 2020.\n\nAditya had come a long way from his first Hour of Code back in 2013 \u2014 the PWA was indeed accepted to be featured in the Hour of Code 2020 during the Computer Science Education Week by Code.org. That was not, however, the end of the journey for CodeCapture. Aditya and his team learned from these experiences, redeveloped their platform, and took it to the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2021, where their team was selected as the National Winner in the Education category at the India Championship.\n\nAmong the many important tenets of service Aditya has learned through his journey, the most important to him is gratitude. Be it a meetup, a seminar, or a hackathon, Aditya remains grateful in any tech community event which has always provided the opportunity to give back to those around him, as reflected in the thesis of CodeCapture. Having the CodeCapture PWA accepted as a featured activity was special for Aditya given his storied past with the event. Had it not been for Hour of Code, he would have never pursued that path of Computer Science that he has grown to love and appreciate so much. This full-circle aspect of his relationship with hackathons keeps Aditya humble and forever grateful. Beyond being grateful for his ability to work in tech, Aditya is also grateful for his community.\n\nAn aspect of the hacker community that he greatly appreciates is the assistance in the development of a plethora of skills \u2014 it was at hackathons that he learned how to build a mobile app, use a database, use an API, and try cloud services, to name a few. These are the building blocks of essential skills implemented by professional developers, which is great for building a resume, but Aditya does not fail to acknowledge the communicative knowledge he gained from his peers. Through the platform of hackathons, he was granted a space to safely interact with like-minded people and a platform to step up and showcase his work without fear of constructive criticism. He has learned how to collaborate and support his peers, as they have done for him.\n\nAs a hackathon organizer for three years, Aditya has navigated the management of both in-person and digital events. These different contexts have granted him even more knowledge of the multiple perspectives that exist in the space. His work with various hackers in search of organizational help or mentorship for upcoming events has opened his eyes. He was even able to share this knowledge of various viewpoints at DevRel Asia 2020 and DevRelCon Tokyo 2021, two of the largest developer relations conferences in the Asia-Pacific region, where he was a speaker. In an effort to spread his experience to even more passionate hackers, he has written articles on the hackathon basics and uplifting developer communities. More recently, in an effort to create a more direct impact on hackers in his country, Aditya collaborated with various Indian student community leaders and co-organized the HackOn 2.0 Hackathon, which, with over 8200 registrations, resulted in one of the largest student-led hackathons in the world.\n\nAditya believes that it is the duty of hackathon organizers such as himself to empathize with their fellow hackers and enable their growth through the transferral of education that they once were given in an effort to foster a healthy community.\n\nThe path Aditya chose wasn\u2019t easy \u2014 he wasn\u2019t dropped into a pre-existing culture of community in his university, nor did he have easily accessible mentors. But that is why he so strongly appreciates the community that he has now. The group that he has now, which he worked to forge, enables him to exceed the limits of knowledge placed upon him by himself and to aspire to reach heights once unimaginable to him. Because of this giving attitude of his peers, he understands that giving back to those in his extensive circle is not a choice, but a necessity he looks forward to advocating for in the future.",

    "about": "Arjun attended their first hackathon, Rose Hack 2019, the same weekend as the Women\u2019s March. Exhausted from the march, they were excited while zipping from Downtown LA to Riverside to go code and meet new people. As a queer person of color, Arjun often feels excluded from tech spaces, but Rose Hack was a warm, intimate, and welcoming environment that they loved. They have amazing memories from the event, like learning about digital signal processing, Python, and Librosa, walking miles with other hackers to get boba, and eating sesame noodles at 3 AM. Arjun worked there with a team to create their favorite project, PyMash, an application that mashes up pairs of songs in a user\u2019s music library and identifies the best mash-ups. They found it really awesome creating a novel algorithm that analyzes pitch intervals and beats to not only produce the mash-ups but quantify their quality. They enjoyed getting excited with the mentors and judges about their project when asking for help and presenting the end product, and the project even won third best hack.\n\nAs a fervent champion of justice, equity, and inclusion in tech, Arjun collaborated with other queer and trans (QT) students at UCLA to organize QWER Hacks, the first collegiate LGBTQIA+ hackathon in the United States. QWER Hacks 2020 increased the visibility of the QT community in tech, and brought QT individuals and allies together to build products that benefit marginalized individuals. Arjun was blown away by the creative and impactful applications that attendees engineered, such as an app that leverages augmented reality to allow trans and non-binary people to experiment with gender expression, and an online game through which parents can practice supporting their QT child via role-playing. Arjun honed a welcoming and inclusive environment at the event by organizing empowering speeches and workshops from QT tech role models. Topics ranged from how deep learning models encode and amplify social biases and how the Trevor Project uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help QT youth in crisis, to imposter syndrome and educational technology. Furthermore, Arjun facilitated intersectional mentorship groups so that attendees could talk with tech leaders who share their identities. Such groups created spaces for often-erased QT voices, like those of bi/pan people of color and trans and gender non-conforming individuals to be heard.\n\nArjun was elated to hear lots of positive feedback from QWER Hacks 2020 attendees. Many found QWER Hacks to be their favorite hackathon, citing its focus on mental health and intersectionality, as well as the lack of toxic masculinity. First-time hackers shared that they never felt comfortable attending any other hackathon, and the event successfully included non-CS students, with many sociology, art, and political science major attendees. Many had even flown across the country for the event, and they emphasized that the safeness and inclusivity of the space validated their decision.\n\nQWER Hacks 2021 was hosted online, and despite worries about how the event would run and how to promote community-building in a virtual space, Arjun is extremely happy about how it turned out. The virtual format made it possible for LGBTQIA+ hackers around the world to attend the hackathon, with attendees from Jamaica, Nigeria, India, China, and more. The event also better prioritized the accessibility of their content with closed captioning and accessible color contrast, as they continue to make their space more inclusive. Attendees continued to amaze Arjun, creating awesome projects such as QUEERCARE, which builds LGBTQIA+ health communities by connecting users to peers, professionals, and resources, and QWERTUNES, which helps users discover LGBTQIA+ artists.\n\nArjun\u2019s QWER Hacks co-organizers became their family, as they spent months contacting sponsors, securing a venue, marketing the event, processing applications, and brainstorming ways to enhance hacker experience and ensure a safe and inclusive space for everyone. Arjun was inspired by the genuine passion of such driven people to increase representation in tech, and their perseverance, enthusiasm, and support were contagious, showing Arjun by example how to stay organized, manage time, and boost morale as a leader. Additionally, one of the co-organizers recommended they apply to Google Queer Tech Voices, and attending that conference granted Arjun the opportunity to meet more amazing queer individuals. QWER Hacks was truly transformative, as it launched Arjun into the world of advocating for the diverse, brilliant, and talented queer people in tech! Most importantly, Arjun is grateful that their QWER Hacks co-organizers could create a space for them to embrace their identity and be openly queer in tech.\n\nIn addition to their work as an organizer for QWER Hacks, Arjun has also been a core organizer of Queer in AI, hosting socials at AAAI 2021 to build a stronger QT community in AI, machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. They have spoken on panels about queerness and intersectionality,\u00a0 organized initiatives to help LGBTQIA+ undergraduates get interested in AI research, and helped students navigate research and graduate school. They are currently organizing the Queer in AI ICML 2021 workshop to highlight the issues that trans, non-binary, and queer BIPOC face.\n\nOrganizing QWER Hacks and Queer in AI has inspired Arjun to continue doing organizational work and oriented them towards conducting academic research that would lead to a future with more equitable technology. Arjun will start their Ph.D. program at UCLA in graph machine learning (ML) and fairness research on a Eugene V. Cota-Robles Fellowship next academic year to become a professor, continuing to promote inclusivity in tech by mentoring marginalized students and collaborating with diverse researchers to promote the importance of representation and unique perspectives in computer science. They will teach and research fairness in how ML models encode and amplify social biases while guiding and encouraging students to solve interesting problems in the field. Arjun is fascinated by the issue of learning fair graph representations without demographics, as graph neural networks can learn problematic and spurious correlations for human-centered downstream tasks, and sensitive metadata is usually unavailable due to privacy laws. They will pursue solutions to this problem as part of their Ph.D. and conduct further research on the intersection of AI and social justice. Arjun recently wrote a paper connecting the harms AI systems pose to queer and trans people to broader societal trends, such as the desire to categorize people, pernicious social biases, and the erasure of nonbinary people, and presented it at the Resistance AI workshop at NeurIPS 2020. Additionally, Arjun is researching the negative effects of gender exclusivity in large language models. In the past, Arjun has worked on a deep learning-based optical system that inexpensively detects microbial resistance to antibiotics, and an interpretable framework for pretraining graph neural networks that improves performance on downstream graph classification tasks with scarce labeled data, like molecular property prediction, which can advance drug discovery and quantum chemistry. Ultimately, they hope to research and build equitable technology and empower and increase the visibility of LGBTQIA+ individuals in ML.\n\nThe future of human-centered AI is extremely concerning to Arjun as it has a track record of having disproportionately adverse effects on oppressed communities such as Black and trans and gender non-conforming individuals. From facial recognition to predictive policing, AI systems have become ubiquitous, yet don\u2019t work and remain opaque in how they actually function. Therefore, exposure to how AI operates sociotechnical influences one\u2019s ability to navigate the world. Since marginalized communities are the most negatively impacted populations, they would stand to gain the most from this exposure through an AI education, informed conversations about the technology, participating in community-based approaches, advocating against AI-induced harms, and pursuing opportunities in the field. However, access to an AI education remains disparate based on socioeconomic status, education level, race, and gender. AI education is only available to self-selected computer science students at privileged universities, and such programs typically fail to discuss the ethical and social implications of AI systems in terms of fairness, accountability, and transparency.\n\nGiven their advocacy for making AI education accessible to all, as Outreach Director of the Association for Computing Machinery AI at UCLA, Arjun launched and taught foundational machine learning concepts and AI ethics at primarily BIPOC, Title I LA schools. They led and worked with a brilliant team of instructors to develop content from scratch, carefully crafting each set of slides, coding Google Collab notebooks, and designing homework assignments. The classes are grounded in dialogue and student-centered learning, encouraging students to consider diverse perspectives and analyze the intersectional effects of AI; for example, students discuss why it's unfair and dangerous that commercial facial-recognition software performs poorly on dark-skinned women. Such conversations work to build a more diverse, aware, empathetic, and ethically-minded AI community, which has strong potential to ameliorate human-centered AI systems.\n\nAt UCLA, Arjun also guided the development of educational technology such as no filter and getting mean about error, made Kahoots, and recorded Tik Toks about ML in order to publish content in a fun, digestible, and accessible manner. They also founded and produced the \u201cYou Belong in AI!\u201d podcast, empowering marginalized youth to pursue AI through inspiring interviews with researchers. Through their education initiatives, Arjun hopes to empower all members of society to talk about AI, fight algorithmic injustices with civic engagement and community-based approaches, and pursue careers in AI.\n\nArjun recently graduated summa cum laude from UCLA Engineering with a degree in computer science as the school-wide Outstanding Bachelor of Science and is now interning with the AllenNLP team at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. They broke ground on AllenNLP\u2019s open-source fairness module, and are working to create easy-to-use metrics and bias mitigation algorithms for people to evaluate and improve the fairness of their language models.",

    "about": "Kelly\u2019s first foray into hacking began when she joined Girls Who Code\u2019s Summer Immersion Program in 2017, which she entered with absolutely no knowledge of coding. After a few weeks of exploring and applying basic programming concepts, Kelly and her peers were challenged to put their new skills to the test by building a creative project themselves. Kelly brought an off-the-cuff idea to the table: a video game with no graphics. She had a Raspberry Pi, a laser cutter, and a week to bring the project to life. After spending days in the Microsoft Garage, Kelly emerged with a working prototype. She had never felt so inspired, and from then on she had the hacking bug.\n\nWith Kelly\u2019s return to school that fall, she longed for opportunities to let out her creative energy \u2013\u00a0 anything to bring about that same unique motivation she felt during her last week of Girls Who Code. After a quick search, Kelly found that these creative outlets existed, and that there was one happening near her next year. Kelly had discovered the MLH hackathon, and promptly signed up.\n\nIt was a small, all-female hackathon that opened Kelly\u2019s eyes to the possibilities of pursuing a vibrant future in tech. Inspired by the event, Kelly took a leap of faith and switched her major from literature and music to computer engineering. She spent the next three years traveling to hackathons, building original projects, and expanding her technical horizons. Among the 12 hackathons that Kelly has participated in, her favorite project was built at LA Hacks in April 2020. Taking her chances with her first solo hack, Kelly built Pragma Once, a SoundCloud rap track made entirely with artificial intelligence. The song featured four AI voices, whose verses were generated using Markov chains from a large body of pre-existing rap songs. The intersection of music and AI has been a longtime interest of Kelly\u2019s, so she took that weekend as an opportunity to explore as much as she could about both in a short amount of time. After spending a majority of the weekend tinkering in GarageBand and syncing the lyrics with the beat, Kelly had a full song, which she demoed on an MLH livestream.\n\nTo Kelly, the greatest joy of a hackathon is pushing her creative boundaries within the confines of the weekend. The freedom and opportunity to learn technologies that seldom appear inside the classroom makes every hackathon an entirely unique experience. During tech interviews, the one constant that has allowed Kelly to bond with her interviewers, who have gone through similar experiences, is her stories of her favorite hackathon projects and memories. These memories and project experiences directly helped her blossom into her role as a Microsoft intern, where she has continued to bring her creative flair.\n\nBeyond the joy of fulfilling her creative goals through hackathons, Kelly also learned how to be fearless in intellectual and social settings. She had finally found a place where she could list off her wild project ideas and people around her would listen and jump in; it was creative chaos and Kelly thrived. These newfound friends supported her as she pitched her projects to judges weekend after weekend, helping her gain confidence as a public speaker. The energy she feels from these hackathon experiences is an energy that Kelly strives to take with her wherever her career may lead.\n\nFrom hacker to organizer to hackathon president, Kelly has gone through the gamut of the responsibilities and perspectives within a hackathon. As president of CruzHacks, she implemented her past experiences from all over California to ensure that the event was organized to the best of her ability, with the wants of hackers at the forefront of the event's plans. By keeping an ear open and being receptive to perspectives from other hackers and organizers, she could best determine what the community wanted from her and her planning committee. After listening to these perspectives, Kelly kept the tenets of the original hackathon spirit in mind while planning CruzHacks.\n\nThose tenets are learning, building, creating, and collaborating. Kelly and her team wanted recent trends of unhealthy competition and business-oriented events to stay far away from the ethos of the competition, and worked to encourage the team-centered model that helped bring Kelly where she is today. Kelly has come a long way in her hacker journey, from a programming novice to a returning Microsoft intern with a desire to change the way her community views hackathons \u2013 a transformation fueled by her love for these niche events.\n\nKelly is empowered by seeing women and queer folks in tech bring their unique, creative perspectives to the table. As the hacker of her community, Kelly encourages her peers to never stop starting. There\u2019s a home for Kelly in hackathons, a vital step in her path that she\u2019ll forever be grateful for, and can always return to.",

    "about": "Growing up, Kamryn believed her only path to success would be behind the footsteps of others, taking a road already paved for her\u2014why risk failure and embarrassment by going in your own direction? She was taught engineering was for the boys, and that a girl should stick to being kind, courteous, and helpful. While Kamryn had a phenomenal support system and academic record, she felt utterly lost in regards to her own personality, and found that she was who others expected or wanted her to be. Technology changed this, giving Kamryn a platform and voice to express herself, and the hacker community acted as a cheering squad for all her endeavors. Hackathons provided opportunities to push her comfort zone by exploring new facets of her passions and self, letting her shatter the stereotypes that once ruled her life. Because of fellow hackers and her experiences, she is no longer afraid to fall as she has a community that would raise her back up. Coding completely changed her ideology, and through a maze of code files she was able to find herself.\n\nKamryn joined the hacker community in summer 2016 through the NYC branch of Kode with Klossy, a nonprofit organization dedicated to closing the gender gap in technology. The empowering community and environment at the camp inspired her to continue studying code on her own and return the following summer for camp at their Chicago branch. As a curious thirteen-year-old, Kamryn began coding in HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Ruby before transitioning to Java, Python, and iOS development with Swift. She fell in love with computer science at the camp and decided to dive deeper into STEM\u2019s ocean of opportunity by attending her first hackathon, Technica 2018. Living in a small town on the coast of Ohio, she pushed herself out of her comfort zone by traveling to College Park, Maryland for the event, and was beyond excited to find such a supportive and motivating community. While she was intimidated at first being so far from home, the positive all-female environment cultivated by hackathon leaders, teammates, and mentors was empowering, keeping her laughing and humming to pop playlists even as she made fatal errors in her project. Technica 2018 pushed her to learn new languages, explore new coding avenues, connect with hundreds of friends, and seek new opportunities. On top of the event\u2019s incredible brain breaks, conversations, and leaders, it allowed her a comfortable and motivational avenue to join the hacker community and guided her professional aspirations towards technology. After Technica 2018, Kamryn went on to intern at NASA Plum Brook, win two awards from TechTogether Boston, attend many more hackathons, and serve as an instructor assistant for Kode With Klossy to teach more young women about the superpower of coding.\n\nKamryn is driven by her dedication to support fellow women in technology and give back to those feeling as lost as she used to. Kamryn was captivated by technology since she became best friends with Google in elementary school, yet she did not have an environment to foster such interest until she branched out from her small hometown and traveled for Kode With Klossy. The experience turned her into a \u201cprofessional nerd\u201d with aspirations of becoming a tech leader, and provided the motivation to push past her fears of failure and complacency to organize a coding club, intern at NASA, and convince her family to let her travel alone to distant hackathons. Life is a revolving door of change, and simply walking through the entrance of a hackathon opens dozens of additional doors to explore new experiences and opportunities.\n\nDespite her positive experiences, Kamryn often wonders about where she would be without finding her catalyst in technology, and worries about other women who may have slipped through the cracks without finding a community to empower them by exploring their interests and selves. Kamryn wonders if she would be happier taking a break, being selfish, or spending more time with her cats and Netflix, but she refuses to let her comfort zone blind her from chances to empower other young women, dedicating herself to empowering others who were also once obsessed with sudoku and had conversations with Google. As an instructor at two remote Kode With Klossy camps in 2020, Kamryn witnessed and was moved by young girls\u2019 moments of realization that they have a passion for programming. Their confidence and dedication to changing the world cleared any doubts Kamryn had blocking her future aspirations, pushing her to do more and be more for her community. While Kamryn is still learning about new facets of herself and her future, the hacker community kickstarted her growth and helped her write her own story. Kamryn aims to study computer science in university and create new ways to provide quality STEM education to all, and she will not stop until the glass ceiling in computer science is shattered.\n\nAt TechTogether Boston 2020, Kamryn reunited with Kode With Klossy alumni (Hana Memon and Sofia Ongele) to create her favorite project, Aurora. They were inspired by the movie Just Mercy to use technology for spreading awareness, providing resources, and connecting different groups to promote social change and spark important conversations. Aurora connects those who were disenfranchised by the criminal justice system with pro-bono legal aid and with legislators. Connecting people in need with those who can provide short-term help and those who can make larger-scale changes allows technology to be a catalyst for creating dialogue so that all voices can be heard. Despite being excited by their plan, such development felt ambitious and even unreasonable to complete in 36 hours; however, they were determined to code and learn as much as possible while they had the opportunity, confidence, and support of those around them. They finished an MVP with hours to spare and implemented additional features and complex APIs to the project. They used Firebase, Google Civic Information API, Apple\u2019s Mapkit, and various Cocoapods to bring Aurora to life, and the assistance of MLH mentors was critical in creating the most technical iOS project Kamryn had ever worked on. Kamryn was extremely grateful when a fellow hacker paused work on their own project to help her debug at 4 am after she encountered devastating errors just hours before the submission deadline. Building Aurora beyond the scope they had originally planned was unbelievably fulfilling, and the project won both Best Political Polarization Hack and Best Philanthropic Hack. The building experience further motivated her to pursue a future in technology, yet the social experience of working with teammates passionate about using tech for social justice, as well as willing to explore new ideas, go for late-night boba tea runs, and find humor in failure, made the event her favorite hackathon ever and showed her the importance of empowerment and positivity in teamwork.\n\nHer NASA mentor once said, \u201cIt\u2019s a disease of the mind to love staring at a screen for hours and still be excited to see a new error code,\u201d and he was totally right that her passion for coding is a bit extreme. Despite being a perfectionist, coding is the place where Kamryn feels free to make mistakes and pursue a wide range of interests, as she sees coding not as a constricting framework of ones and zeros, but as an amazing catalyst of creativity, storytelling, and solutions for global crises with almost infinite potentialities. She wants to harness this superpower to continue giving back to the community that supported and raised her to be who she is today. Hackathons have given Kamryn a place to find like-minded people that share the same passions as her, which was incredibly hard to come by as a \u201csmall-town girl living in a lonely world.\u201d Before learning to code and joining the hacker community, she believed cities could not get any larger than Cleveland, Ohio for her, but now through tech, she has the world at her fingertips.",

    "website": "",
    "about": "Without a computer science program in her high school, Fawziyah had never considered a career in tech. She thought that she wanted to be a lawyer. She didn\u2019t know why, but she knew she liked talking. And if you like talking, you\u2019d like law, or so she was told. But her idea of her career changed during a science fair when she was introduced to the Girls Who Code program, and was even offered to have her transportation and lunch covered for the summer. Fawziyah was totally fascinated by computer science, an area she had no prior introduction to. This interest paired with the gracious deal was a no-brainer. She applied, got accepted, and finally she had something new to talk passionately about.\n\nDuring the weeks of the program, Fawziyah began to learn coding that she used to build projects that she cared about, without the added stress of cost. For instance, she built a website dedicated to educating users about sexual assault. She was able to publish the site, already bringing important issues to light at age 16. Being surrounded by other women in tech meant she was surrounded by great mentors that led her through web development, programming, and CS. It was empowering to be around women in tech with access to technology that she did not have previously.\n\nAfter her completion of the GWC Program, Fawziyah was left with an inkling of coding knowledge and a list of nearby hackathons from one of her peers. She took it upon herself to attend Technica, a nearby event accessible to high schoolers like herself, where she saw just how deep the software engineering industry runs. This was priceless information for Fawziyah who was fresh off of her program with only a bit of an idea of what a tech career could look like. Following the hackathon came a career fair, where she saw that she was already building skills for career paths that she didn\u2019t know were even available. It was unbelievable to her that companies like Google would be at events such as this for the sake of scouting. Though she wasn\u2019t submitting, Fawziyah saw the event through to the end, fascinated to see the people of different ages and experience bring their creations to life. The combination of the two events helped her come to the conclusion that she wanted to work toward the goal of becoming a software engineer like those she had spoken to.\n\nA few hackathons later, Fawziyah joined the MLH Fellowship program in 2020. The virtual curriculum gave her the chance to write code that would be used publicly for the first time. At this point her experience had grown immensely, which she brought to the table at a hackathon where she and her team built a tool that acted as a CRM for your contact book. The project compiled your notes after introduction and even information such as birthdays. They had seen the implementation of this idea previously, but the team set out to put their own personal spin on it. The support that she and her team saw for the project reinforced the idea that building on previous ideas is just as important as entirely new ones. Even if an idea has seen results in one area, the same idea could be built on and brought to a different area and see entirely new results. Comparison to others is a part of growing, but when Fawziyah gets in her head about solving a problem with a fully unique angle, she remembers that hackathon to bring her back to the ground.\n\nIn order to give back to the community, Fawziyah works as a teacher and an MLH Coach. For six years, she\u2019s taught web development to students from her high school. The school never had a dev program, so she and a friend that went through GWC made it a goal to bring all that they learned to their fellow students, and it had a lasting impact. They partnered with Google CS First in order to build an appropriate curriculum that covers grades 8-12. In a school with a lot of low-income students, this opportunity has been huge. The students have been able to bring their experience and passion to the county in order to get the necessary funding they deserve. Seeing that students would leave the workshops with a true excitement for coding was an immediate sign to keep with it, returning every Friday. She took it a step further by becoming an MLH Coach so that she can give access to tech through events like hackathons and workshops like MLH Localhost. Knowing more about the process of being behind the scenes has been eye-opening for her. When a group of students came to Fawziyah for advice on a project, she had every answer, and she knew that she was putting her degree and learned skills to use in order to help others.\n\nHaving come a long way through the hackathon process, she knew it was time to undertake the challenge of organizing a hackathon. Black Wings Hacks was born in February 2021, an event built to amplify women or non-binary people and the intersection of being a black person in tech. The categories and prizes were designed to encourage impact on the community. Over half of the 250 attendees were first-time hackers, and the event did it\u2019s job to expose many black women to coding. This alone was fulfilling to Fawziyah, who was given so much by her first hackathon. It was hectic, of course, to be the focal point of any questions and concerns throughout the event, but giving new and old hackers access to resources is how Fawziyah has helped for years.\n\nEmpathy is important, and Fawziyah continues to learn and build as an empath alongside her community. By seeing the various sects and areas every hacker brings to the table, she subconsciously builds a network of experiences to draw from when necessary. Since the beginning of her time with GWC, she\u2019s become a lot more patient, recognizing the hyper-specific lives of individuals. As a future software engineer and coding professor, a career built on fundamental understanding of the people you create projects for, the skill is invaluable. She\u2019s seen how far reaching the community is through her time with programs such as MLH, and the varied experiences that come with such a large body of interested people in tech. Everybody\u2019s story is important for growth in the community, and the same goes for Fawziyah.",

    "about": "During her time as a freshman at UT Dallas, a hackathon organizer spoke to her class about the benefits of hackathons, and Medha\u2019s interest was piqued. She had no idea how much the event would have in store for her. Met with equal parts passion and cutting edge technology, she found a place where she thrived among her peers. At her first HackUTD, she worked on Klo Kloset, a project that produced outfit combinations based on a user's closet. The team didn\u2019t finish the project, but it was the synthesis of everybody\u2019s passion for fashion and the knowledge that Medha gained that made it a memorable, lasting introduction to hackathons.\n\nNoticing the disparity of women and hearing why that may exist from her female cohort, Medha made it her focus to help women and non-binary students in tech feel more included. Medha created an event called EMP-WR, a weeklong camp with a curriculum aimed toward introducing more young women into STEM. She taught binary code, cybersecurity, and solar energy to fifteen students, all of which left the camp amazed by the opportunities of the tech world. Being the start of any of these students' potential dip into tech was just the beginning of positive steps toward change that Medha believes so strongly in, going on to create the first STEM Center + MakerSpace. Now over 1,000 girls have access to facilities to learn the fun of STEM.\n\nMedha continues to empower young women in STEM through her work as an organizer. As a new logistics coordinator of HackUTD, she brought a fresh perspective to the table. She noticed that there were more and more gender-focused hackathons rising to popularity, and saw this as a great opportunity to pitch her team. The pitch was a success, and WEHack was born. The event brought in organizations focused on women in tech. This created a great support system in general and helped to ease the dramatic shift from in-person to virtual hackathons.\n\nFrom organizing HackUTD, Medha understood the basic needs of a hackathon, but then the switch to virtual hackathons came. On top of that, the added pressure of trying to make WEHack a successful first time event immediately made the situation more intense. The unexpected chaos ended up being a catalyst, teaching Medha to assess and take calculated risks with the structure of the event, and stretching outside of her comfort zone to reach out to people that seemed impossible to get, but more often than not, the risk paid off.\n\nThey interviewed, raised funds, and learned to lead together as a group of 28 vetted organizers. This group mindset made WEHack come to life, drawing in 238 passionate hackers. As it all ended, Medha was flooded with messages from everyone involved expressing their thankfulness for such a fun event. The messages detailing the way that certain speakers never had a moment of disinterest, or how hackers felt their projects\u2019 ability to make a true difference are the moments that made Medha realize that her ultimate goal had come to life. She left WEHack feeling proud of her event that succeeded in creating a sense of unity among women and non-binary folks from around the world.\n\nMedha has plans to take her skills as an organizer to her professional career. She dreams of bringing together her community experience with her technical expertise, and hopes to eventually head up a tech company one day.\u00a0 For now, she got a headstart with internships at Amazon Web Services, Intel, Toyota, and PowerSchool, all of which have provided her with different perspectives on the tech industry.\n\nThese chances to bring past experiences for the sake of helping and uplifting women and non-binary people in tech are what fuel Medha. The chance to expose people to the community that she loves so much is a reward that continues to give back. With big dreams of becoming a VP, Medha has set herself up for success.",

    "about": "Amy was terrible at math growing up, so she assumed she would have no penchant for anything STEM-related. It wasn\u2019t until college that she heard about hackathons, and the thought of being a \u201chacker\u201d gave her the James-Bond-esque vibes that she was itching to explore. As a non-STEM major, she was initially intimidated by building projects with random teammates, so she signed up as a volunteer at SD Hacks to snoop on other people\u2019s projects. Amy was impressed by the projects attendees had built in 36 hours, and she wanted to see if she could do it herself. She attended her next hackathon as a hacker, and after her project won a prize, she felt motivated to keep attending more events. Amy went to 18 events her freshman year at university and was motivated to spend every weekend learning how to code\u2014she says her 18-year-old self was \u201cbuilt differently.\u201d\n\nThe first computer science class Amy audited had three girls. During her freshman year at university, she tried to sneak into an upper-level computer science course, but the professor immediately pointed at her and said, \u201cI know you\u2019re not in my class because there are only two girls in this class.\u201d. The underrepresentation of women in computer science can set a daunting scene for women who want to get into coding, but hackathons such as TreeHacks and AthenaHacks allowed Amy to comfortably be herself and unapologetically explore her interests. At her first few hackathons, Amy hid her major because she thought her teammates wouldn\u2019t take her seriously or let her code, but at TreeHacks, after sheepishly telling her teammates she was a business major, they responded, \u201ccool,\u201d and it turned out that none of them were computer science majors either. Amy took STEM classes at school that she was interested in, but she often felt alone among all the computer science students so her experience at TreeHacks was welcoming and comforting. AthenaHacks was also a strange yet amazing experience for Amy to see all the womxn hackers\u2014there was an unspoken sense of solidarity as they were all minorities in technology, but they belonged there. At these hackathons, she never felt the need to prove her credibility and she found a beautiful and welcoming space to create in.\n\nAmy joined the hackathon organizing team at her university to carve out the previously-non-existent niche for hackers outside the computer science major and women. Amy believes a hackathon\u2019s organizers should reflect the hackers they want to attend the event, and many non-STEM majors and female hackers attended SLO Hacks because they saw her running the event. After hosting several hackathons, Amy found another way to give back to the hackathon community as managing director of Poly Canyon Ventures, her school\u2019s non-profit student-run venture fund. The fund annually gives grants, investments, and guidance to student startups that win Camp PolyHacks\u2019 cleantech hack category, and being able to financially support hackers means a lot to her. Some funded projects includes Leoco, a web extension that lets users shop locally to reduce carbon emissions, TrashTalk, a sustainability platform where users compete against each other by collecting the most trash to win prizes, and Remit, a borderless P2P payment system not bound by phone model, OS, or internet due to its use of blockchain and SMS (who went on to demo the project for cryptocurrency developer Xpring\u2019s Board of Directors). She is currently working on launching an Opportunity Fund within Poly Canyon Ventures to invest in talented hackers and entrepreneurs that are minorities in tech; only 10% of venture capital deals go to women, people of color, and LGBTQIA+ founders, so Amy wants to help make that number grow. At MLH Hackcon VIII, Amy gave a presentation about empowering underrepresented hackers, which you can check out here.\n\nAmy feels like she embodies the hacker persona while defying its stereotypes: she is a scrappy, resourceful builder who collaborates with other caffeine-fiends to build projects that can change the world. Amy has gained a lot from the hackathon community, learning how to code from MLH Hackathons, making close friends through organizing, and overcoming insecurities stemming from imposter syndrome in the tech space. Mentors and other hackers showed Amy that it\u2019s really okay to channel her inner \u201ctech-bro,\u201d building video games and investing in stocks, while still enjoying \u201cnon-tech-bro\u201d things like baking and fashion. Amy plans to continue giving back to the hacker community by mentoring female hackers at hackathons, recruiting non-STEM majors on organizing teams, funding student startups, and ultimately, shifting the perspective of what it means to be a \u201chacker.\u201d\n\nAmy\u2019s dream after graduation is to become a full-time product manager in the Bay Area,\u00a0 despite how difficult it is to break into product management from a non-engineering background. Joining the hacker community taught her the technical knowledge needed to facilitate productive conversations with fellow engineers. She sees this as the beauty of hackathons, that even a business major like herself can walk into a room full of bright minds and soylent, and come out with new friends, skills, and even a startup idea.\n\nAmy\u2019s favorite project to work on was SURGE.on, a VR app that democratizes medical center career paths for students in underrepresented communities. No one on her team had ever touched VR before, but Amy had played Beat Sabers once on an Oculus and desperately wanted to try VR development. After borrowing an Oculus, they struggled to set up the VR environment until 4 hours before the deadline, where they (in true hacker fashion) downed three shots of espresso to demo a successful prototype to the judges. The project won first place and the whole experience felt like a fever dream, but it led Amy to realize that she could build more than just a website.",

    "about": "When Erin first arrived at Columbia, she was unsure that Software Engineering was the career path for her. She had a past with competitive coding but was worried that Computer Science wouldn\u2019t give her the opportunity to express her creative side. Luckily, Erin joined the Columbia Daily Spectator\u2019s product engineering team, where she learned some basic web development skills. Armed with the fundamentals of React, Erin signed up for Columbia\u2019s student-led diversity hackathon, DivHacks, where she built a small website about women in technology, and soon saw her fears about a lack of creativity in software engineering melt away.\n\nErin\u2019s growing web development skills, combined with support and passion from other student technologists she met through Columbia hackathons, suddenly opened up the door to building anything that she wanted. Soon after DivHacks, she was accepted into hackNY\u2019s Class of 2020 fellowship, which helped Erin become an MLH Fellow in Batch 0. Quickly, this series of events skyrocketed Erin into the hacker community.\n\nErin\u2019s hackathon engagement continued to expand through early 2020\u2014in the spring of 2020, Erin and her friends entered DevFest, Columbia\u2019s student hackathon. The night before the event, they all hung out around the dinner table and talked about their lives, revealing issues and hardpoints that could be solved through technology. This led to the creation of Timesort, a web application that crafts a schedule personalized for students to remove the stress of time management. During the actual hackathon, the initial, hacked-together version of Timesort contained lots of bugs and did not work as her team dreamed it would. But as news of the project got around the hackathon, Erin and her team found that a majority of students had a need for their fledgling project\u2014 in the months following the hackathon, Erin and her team spent months interviewing customers, interrogating design choices, and rebuilding Timesort.\n\nThe dedication to the idea paid off\u2014 Timesort\u2019s team was accepted into Columbia\u2019s startup accelerator program, Almaworks, where Erin and her team were mentored about how to market and launch the project effectively to her peers. A year later, her team continues working to make Timesort a standout time-management tool for students. The process of seeing her small, buggy hackathon project turn into a completed product has been extremely rewarding, and a frequent reference point for Erin when she looks back on the potential of CS.\n\nAs a former MLH Fellow, she\u2019s used her experiences with hackNY and her fellowship to turn the isolation of quarantine into a time for her passion for computer science and impact in the hacker computer to grow and grow. The hackNY community was an inspiration to her \u2014 as she watched COVID expose fundamental flaws in US society, Erin grew doubtful that a career in technology could be a viable way to enact meaningful change. Her experience in hackNY assuaged this worry by demonstrating the precise methods through which technology can be used to make a positive impact in the world, with both immediate and long-lasting results. She heard founders, technology ethicists, and nonprofit leaders talk about how they founded values-based, ethical technology companies that made a genuine impact in the world, and learned about other fellow\u2019s involvement in civic tech and nonprofits. Erin left that summer with a renewed faith in technology\u2019s potential for social good, and with a community of talented technologists who she knew she could lean on.\n\nAs a part of hackNY\u2019s focus on social good, Erin was paired with finEQUITY, a nonprofit that seeks to help incarcerated people improve their credit score and financial literacy. Her team worked to automate finquity\u2019s mailing process for sending financial literacy education modules to incarcerated people. She took on a backend developer role despite her usual role as a frontend developer, and was initially intimidated by the unknowns of the project. Once again, her community lifted her up by hosting frequent pair programming calls to learn Node and Serverless development. She ultimately learned so much from her peers that she stuck with finequity through the rest of 2020, documenting the application and tying up the loose ends of the project for production.\n\nAs a developer, MLH and the variety of global perspectives that come along with it were essential to Erin\u2019s growth. Hours spent pair programming with her mentor as well as her podmates left her with new knowledge of Vue and Typescript. The opportunity to hear from developers all over the world gave her plenty of expertise and advice, enabling her to make an impact within her various communities. After such an impactful summer with MLH and hackNY, Erin returned to Columbia with a renewed commitment to make an impact on her community through teaching others web development and building technology to bring the Columbia community together.\n\nThe combination of experience from hackathons, hackNY, and MLH equipped Erin with knowledge of web development skills that have enabled her to excel in her tech career. Currently, Erin utilizes her technology skills as the Head of Engineering at the Columbia Daily Spectator and as a Software Engineering Intern at MongoDB. Beyond technical prowess, the most valuable skill that Erin has acquired as a young technologist is perseverance.\n\nNavigating through large, unfamiliar codebases and tracking down the last few bugs in her projects are just a few of the challenges Erin faces. As a queer woman in tech, she faces challenges surrounding equity in computer science firsthand. Through programs such as MLH provide global, diverse perspectives, it doesn\u2019t always mean that voices are lifted up equally. Erin works to overcome these problems by using her leadership positions to make tech spaces more inclusive as a supportive role model. Her story highlights how quickly people can grow by dedicating themselves to technology and developer communities. She was lucky to grow along with the MLH Fellowship as a part of Batch 0 as they all navigated the new experience.\n\nMost recently, she has persevered to finish a three year old project at the Columbia Daily Spectator, where she finished migrating columbiaspectator.com from JSP to React. With a looming deprecation date for the JSP site in June, Erin taught herself how to use Spectator\u2019s publishing platform and successfully deployed the new site in May. While finishing up that project, she also led her team to build and deploy LionClubs, a web application to connect Columbia students with clubs at the university. She was recently awarded the Jim Pagels Memorial Prize for her dedication to Columbia Spectator\u2019s community.\n\nBecause of the time and valuable perspective that she has dedicated as a mentor and volunteer with hackNY, MLH, and Columbia, Erin\u2019s impact in her community is far reaching. She has reviewed hundreds of applications for the incoming classes of hackNY and aspiring global hackers of MLH, and has been there as a form of support and advice for those that join the team. At Columbia, Erin has been able to give back to younger students by teaching web development and Python. Even with students that might not consider themselves \u2018hackers,\u2019 Erin makes it a point to adopt the spirit of helpfulness and passion for engineering in order to make them feel welcome. As a teaching assistant for Columbia\u2019s Data: Past, Present, and Future interdisciplinary applied math and history course, she\u2019s even able to bring her knowledge to different areas of study and work with students from different backgrounds. In addition to her other work at Spectator, Erin has also revamped their web development training program, during which she frequently encourages the new engineers to engage with MLH and hackNY, just as she did.\n\nIt is thanks to hackNY that Erin believes in the power of social change and the ability of the hacker community to make that change happen. She commits herself to sharing her knowledge with younger developers, as she reaps the rewards of her effort through the incredible growth from the engineers that she mentors. In the future, she hopes to broaden the impact that these fellowships, which have made such an impact in her own life, have on other young technologists while working to make the hacker community more inclusive and diverse for generations of developers to come.",

    "about": "Even though it was Ethan\u2019s idea to switch his major from Physics to Computer Science, he couldn\u2019t help but feel that he didn\u2019t know what he was doing. He was a freshman in college with little knowledge of the possibilities of CS, scraping along with his classmates. After opening up to an upperclassman about his recent trouble, he was told about a few students that had just started a hackathon planning team. They called it CUhackit. Ethan wasn\u2019t familiar with the idea of a hackathon, but joined the students anyway. Together, they spent six months planning into the late-night, messaging on Slack and bonding over the weeks of hangouts. Not only did these friends help Ethan become a leader and innovator, they helped him finally solidify a place in the world of coding.\n\nAfter the stress of changing majors and struggling to find his footing, it\u2019s important for Ethan to remind himself to just have fun. It\u2019s easy to miss out on parties and hangouts that fly by when you\u2019re caught up in work that you care about, but Ethan made a point to enjoy his work even more by taking risks for the sake of infusing some more enjoyment. He decided to go out on a limb during a recent hackathon with a more \u2018out there\u2019 idea. When he told a sponsor at the event about his idea, they responded: \u201cHow is that useful?\u201d Ethan answered honestly. It wasn\u2019t practical, but it was something that he enjoyed making.\n\nThis gave him confidence in his ability to find the simple happiness in the projects that he would work on in order to solve important problems. There was a time to work and be productive, but at this specific hackathon, he was free to have fun, and he doesn't regret taking the risk that he did.\n\nAfter graduating from CUhackit events to hackathons that he had no part in planning, Ethan still found a way to bring the leadership skills that he learned from his friends into this new environment. He hadn\u2019t yet helmed a project in a major way, but at Vandyhacks V, he was given that opportunity. Ethan\u2019s project, Hip Empathy Friend, became his favorite because of the confidence in being a leader that it instilled in him.\n\nThe hackathon community at Clemson was small when Ethan joined as a freshman but he\u2019s watched himself grow with it, which has been an incredibly rewarding experience. It was hard at first to not have a community laid out with perfectly-aligned interests, but this gave him time to learn about himself, his place in CS and what he wants to achieve. Upholding the importance of the diversity of technologies and perspectives is a major major issue that Ethan zeroed in on during his time at hackathons. Seeing so many different stories, projects and tools that people have used for the sake of changing the world gives Ethan the belief that the status quo doesn\u2019t work well for everyone. In fact, he believes that the status quo exists to be broken in order to ensure that the world of tech doesn\u2019t just reinforce the inequalities that we already have. The exposure to different perspectives at hackathons is the most valuable tool that Ethan hopes to bring into a career in software engineering.\n\nHe was then able to bring part of that new-found purpose and experience to CUhackit. In hopes of bridging the cultural divide, they\u2019ve worked on an NSF-backed project to bring hackathons to Botswana, where their faculty advisor was on a Fulbright. The six-month planning period looked overwhelming at first, but Ethan was able to bring all that he had learned over the years in order to help the idea grow.\n\nAs an organizer, Ethan makes it his mission to bring the value of mentorship, the same way that his peers brought mentorship to him during his first go with CUhackit. Whether it\u2019s giving practice interviews or larger cultural changes like hackathon strategy, he makes it his goal to pay it forward. That's what's made Hello World, a Clemson freshman-only hackathon he helped start in 2018, so special to him. Like him, a lot of students come into college without knowing much about computer science, and especially in some of the rural areas around Clemson, far less built-in support for learning and networking. Things like Hello World and the partnership he helped establish between CUhackit and the smaller colleges around upstate South Carolina are the way he thinks hackathons should always work--a rising tide that lifts all boats.\n\nEthan and his friends at CUhackit count themselves as lucky to be a part of a community that will always work towards uplifting voices that may not have had the opportunities to speak otherwise.",

    "about": "As Disha entered her first hackathon, Los Altos Hacks II, she and her teammate were both excited to bring their first original project to the table. Taking place around the time of the unfolding refugee crisis in Aleppo, Disha hoped to work on a project that would raise awareness of the humanitarian crisis. With this goal in mind and with the help of their mentors, the pair attempted to create a web-based game that would gamify the struggles experienced by the civilians of Aleppo, aiming to raise awareness for the urgency for humanitarian relief.\n\nThe project came with its share of struggles, resulting in an imperfect prototype. Even though the project wasn\u2019t an immediate success, Disha was left with inspiration from the immense power of technology to educate individuals on current events and social issues which demand unity.\n\nDisha brought this budding inspiration to future hackathons, where she worked on her favorite project, DeepCheck. It worked as a proof of concept of how vitriolic social media activity might be discovered through machine intelligence to be evaluated by law enforcement officials to complement or augment accepted background checks for firearm licenses. She and her teammate utilized the power of sentiment analysis and web development to allow for more robust background checks surrounding firearm purchases. DeepCheck won \u2018Best Use of Human-Centered AI\u2019 from Underscore VC, and even saw room for development at other events. The potential future that DeepCheck left Disha and her team with gave them something to hold close to their hearts.\n\nAs a woman in tech, Disha has taken part in founding two hackathons with the goal of female empowerment: Superposition and Hack(H)er413. These events became the first hackathons entirely constituted of women and non-binary folks in both the San Francisco Bay Area and Western Massachusetts. Moments like this that create a safe space for women and non-binary hackers to explore technology and build community are the reasons why Disha finds the path of technology for social good so fulfilling. And she\u2019s taken it even further as the Director of Hack(H)er413\u2019s second annual hackathon. She successfully raised over $100k+ for women-empowering hackathons, which has enabled events to provide day-of resources and the opportunities for hackers to learn about career options directly from sponsors.\n\nWith such a wide variety of social issues addressed in her projects, Disha has learned how much of an impact technology has on social change. Every discipline has the potential for growth with the aid of technology as long as a passionate hacker mines that specific technology to the greatest of their ability. She cites the collaborative environment of hackathon arenas as a part of the great passion that she has for combining her deepest interests in social good and tech. Now manifesting this passion beyond creating projects to organize hackathons, Disha has made lifelong friends with her wide network of fellow eager hackers.\n\nWorking on a hackathon project requires each team member to wear multiple hats of different specializations, which means Disha is familiar with the task of balancing development, design, and working towards a multilateral goal. This layered process paired with an interest in the intersection of tech and business-led Disha to understand that the hat she wears best is product management.\n\nAt TechTogether Boston, while working on DeepCheck, she learned the importance of constantly considering user interest when working on the web platform to display the results of the team\u2019s machine learning model. At #BattleoftheCamps, while working on GeoTool, she learned how to ideate features and project ideas that stemmed from one overarching mission. Keeping goals such as this in mind guide a range of processes from ideation, to design, to development, to presentation. These steps, along with the time crunch of a hackathon, have prepared her for any future career path.\n\nThrough hackathon participation and volunteer efforts as an organizer in her four years in tech, Disha\u2019s path has been deeply rooted in fighting for social change and equality. Her projects, like DeepCheck, are examples of the care she puts into increasing the safety of the everyday life of individuals. As an organizer, she has empowered gender minorities in the tech industry across multiple states. She\u2019s grateful to have been given the opportunity to make her mark in these ways, and she hopes to return to local hackathons as a sponsor in the following years in order to give back and empower participants to hack for the common good.",

    "age": "21",
    "devpost": "",
    "github": "",
    "linkedin": "",
    "website": "",
    "about": "Layan\u2019s Computer Science track didn\u2019t start as expected. Yes, she came into Emory with the intent of a CS/Applied Mathematics major on the pre-med track, but her first introductory CS course was not all roses.\n\nShe ended up withdrawing from the class with the intent to change majors, which led her to Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology (NBB). She loved NBB, but deep down still had an interest in CS that she hadn\u2019t been given the full opportunity to explore. Layan spotted a Facebook flyer promoting a medical hackathon hosted by Johns Hopkins called MedHacks. After getting over the initial surprise of finding this perfect combination of her interests, she signed up. The experience was amazing, resulting in the creation of a project that tackled an issue in the medical field. Meeting people from all over the world, each at different stages in their career, motivated Layan to compete in more hackathons, and she\u2019s never regretted it.\n\nAmong the seven hackathons Layan has participated in so far, her favorite work has been on the Offline Movement project at the Global Developer Challenge. The event took place during the summer of 2020, the peak of COVID-19 and the mass outcry for social justice across the U.S., which forced Layan to break out of her comfort zone by reaching out to people that she had never met. What began as an uncomfortable concept became an immediate reward, helping her to connect with people during such a novel time. As a Black Muslim woman living in the United States, the protests hit home for Layan. She and her team took the necessity for social change and turned their experiences into Offline Movement, a phone application that allows users to connect to others without using cellular data or the internet.\n\nTo enforce privacy, the app included encrypted messages and tools to blur individuals\u2019 faces in photos and videos. The privacy of communication at the forefront of Offline Movement makes it a savior during disaster situations and mass gatherings. The importance of this was noticed by the hackathon judges too, as the team ended up winning first place out of 34 teams. This win, and the impact she made, made this her most fulfilling project to date.\n\nLooking back, it\u2019s hard to deny the growth Layan has gone through since her first hackathon. Where she once thought that the fields of tech and healthcare lived separately, she now sees that both are very interdisciplinary. The introduction to so many people that share similar interests with Layan has left her even more fulfilled. For example, one of Layan\u2019s team members that took part in Offline Movement is currently seeking to apply CS innovations to medicine as a current med student at Uniformed Services University. Layan was even able to bring the pressing issue of the pandemic to a hackathon that addressed the issue of returning to work after COVID-19. One of the judges, after seeing the project\u2019s honorable mention, reached out to her and her team to see if they would like to pursue the project further. Seeing these shared interests grow in others alongside her has only bolstered Layan\u2019s passion for both CS and medicine.\n\nThe tech skills Layan is learning along the way are becoming more and more applicable to individuals who are pursuing an MD-PhD, which is Layan\u2019s ultimate goal, due to the significant research aspect of the career. The computational aspect of a career in public health and neuroscience comes from the need for knowing how to code for the sake of data analysis. With this in mind, Layan took it upon herself to learn Python as well as R and R Studio. Her long nights of hacking and working with different teams at hackathons has prepared her for the long hours a physician-scientist may be faced with. Thanks to hackathons, it\u2019s key to Layan that she recognizes any potential to build skills that suit her desired career field and beyond.\n\nLayan\u2019s story in the hacker community is very non-traditional. She\u2019s not the typical CS major that came into undergraduate studies with years and years of coding experience. Having nearly fallen out of the tech field entirely, she\u2019s more than grateful that hackathons led her to see the desire that stuck in the back of her head during her tech hiatus. Layan is a testament to the ability to bounce back in the tech field, thanks to her immense drive and helpful community. She considers herself relatively fresh, making her start in 2018 because of her passion for medicine and tech. Her ability to recognize the interdisciplinary nature of the two and her drive to combine them made her specific path unique. Through this drive came more and more unique opportunities and knowledge. She hopes that this non-traditional path can be an example to other aspiring hackers that there is not a right way to break into tech.\n\nThe field is so large that it doesn\u2019t mandate everyone following the same path to belong in the hacker community. It\u2019s important to Layan to be an example that winning hackathons isn\u2019t everything. It took over a year of competition for her to place in an event. But the lessons learned, skills gained, projects created, and people met are the reasons that she attends hackathons. Being yourself and pursuing your interests will be enough to make you stand out.",

    "about": "For most, the door into their career doesn\u2019t present itself until later in life. But for Sam, it was in the fifth grade.\u00a0Sam\u2019s interest in programming was sparked by a makeathon held by his teacher, which then led him to participate in the building process with his school's coding class that same year. He learned HTML, CSS and JS alongside his classmates at school, in lessons that gave him the confidence to experiment at home, where he still tinkers away to this day.\n\nBecause he started programming so early, Sam had years to hone his skill. He eventually felt pent up with creative energy, hoping to find a widespread hacker community that he could share ideas with while learning from others. When browsing the internet he saw a screenshot of a Slack for a group called Hack Club, the perfect outlet to put his years of tinkering experience to use.\n\nWith the online Hack Club, a trove of opportunities opened up and he learned about similar communities such as MLH which led to him participating in events such as Local Hack Day, NotUniversity Hacks and Hack Club\u2019s Slackathon. Bit by bit, with his constant exposure to hackathons, he met hundreds of fellow hackers while building fulfilling projects. His favorite project is \u2018The Nerfanator.\u2019 Like many hackathon experiences, the story goes further than just a project because his friends were beginners and he could introduce them to a community that he is passionate about. The project began with Sam and his friends meeting up one weekend to build an automated Nerf gun system that used machine learning to detect people going up a staircase. For them, this project was an opportunity to learn new skills and have fun with programming.\u00a0Needless to say, Sam has come a long way from his fifth grade class.\n\nProjects such as the Nerfanator are emblematic of what Sam loves about the path he\u2019s chosen: the community. Through communities such as MLH & Hack Club, Sam gets the opportunity to meet other hackers of different cultures and systems of thinking, which he sees as a life-changing experience.\n\nNot only does he credit his peers for widening his worldview, but for the personal growth he\u2019s seen over the years. This growth goes beyond green GitHub graphs. He\u2019s been pushed out of his comfort zone, resulting in knowledge of his new favorite framework, NextJS. His community taught him how to collaborate with others over code, how to be flexible and how to communicate with others\u2014physically and virtually. He knows not to take these skills for granted, and can\u2019t wait to implement what he\u2019s been taught by his peers in a modern workplace.\n\nWith newfound problem solving and critical thinking skills in his wheelhouse, Sam has an understanding and appreciation for the nitty-gritty logistical work needed to power events such as hackathons. Part of this understanding comes from appreciation. Qualities of determination and resilience are not overlooked by Sam. This attention to detail among his projects and his peers is what helps make his work stand out. The way that Sam has been impacted by his peers drives him to make a difference among others.\n\nDuring the summer of 2020, Sam put his organizational skills to use with the Summer of Making. The opportunity was presented to him by GitHub and Hack Club, who saw the invaluable work that he put into the community, to create the best summer program for high school hackers.\n\nGitHub provided $50,000 for use in distributing hardware to hackers. With this, Sam and his team members were able to fund 300 unique hardware projects to makers in 143 different cities, from Lagos to Los Angeles. Seeing the impact that these grants made on both the recipients\u2019 ability to create and make a change is what fulfilled Sam the most. Some highlights include the works of a hacker who used the grant to make a machine-learning algorithm to help people diagnose Kawasaki disease and another that used their grant to create a Humanitarian Activist Award-winning humanoid robot.\n\nThroughout the summer, the Hack Club\u2019s Slack saw an all-time high of activity. More and more students could connect and share projects while making the long-lasting projects that Sam himself values so much.\n\nSchool presented more of a challenge after the technology program was uprooted by the departure of a teacher, but Sam chose to see it as an opportunity. Where some might throw their hands up and give up, he found a way to fill the gap\u2014Innovation Week. The week-long celebration of making and hacking gave students the opportunity to try STEM outside of regular classroom learning. Participants, including himself, were shown the draw of a STEM major instead of the harmful stereotypes once associated with it.\n\nSam was able to undertake a new challenge by hosting his local region\u2019s Local Hack Day: Share, something he had never done before. It was one thing to work with his school, but another thing entirely to host an all-virtual event. The stakes felt higher, but watching others participate in activities, sharing their projects, and engaging with the event that Sam had worked to build proved that high risks definitely yielded high rewards because yet again, he managed to bring community to others in the same group that supported him\u2014a goal he intends to keep for the remainder of his career.",

    "about": "Jacky attended his first hackathon nwHacks in high school with very little coding experience under his belt. It was his first time stepping into the world of technology outside of a classroom, and he discovered the electric feeling of making a project come to life in just 24 hours. Since nwHacks, Jacky has used hackathons as a place to spend a weekend learning a certain piece of technology, building an idea that has been on his mind, as well as a place to meet interesting and passionate creators regardless of whether they're a high school student or PhD graduate. Jacky now organizes hackathons as a part of nwPlus, and on his own time contributes to open-source materials and competes in the occasional hackathon.\n\nHaving a leadership position at nwPlus may have the time commitment of a full-time job, but he sees it as being part of a family with all of the benefits and commitments that come with it. The hackathon community has provided him with a group of people he feels comfortable around, and nwPlus showed him how amazing it is to work on a passion project alongside people he cares for. Going to hackathons alone and meeting some of the coolest teammates he could ask for has taught him that it is ok to reach out to people and ask to work together. As a part of the MLH Fellowship, he got the support he needed to engage with and contribute to the sometimes overwhelming Open Source community. Throughout the Fellowship, Jacky was astounded by the talented work of the other Fellows, and greatly appreciated the support of his mentor, who felt just like a really smart friend that held Jacky\u2019s best interests at heart. The Fellowship taught him to be confident in his own skills and pursue what he is interested in rather than waiting for someone to tell him what he is capable of. He also realized that there are so many incredibly smart people building amazing hacks and that instead of feeling intimidated by them, it is better to learn and work on projects alongside them.\n\nAs an organizer, a workshop leader, and a hacker, he has done a bit of everything around hackathons, and such familiarity makes him even more appreciative of events. He is amazed by the number of people he has met and learned from, and he thanks the hacker community for many of his friends. He loves the forging of connections between people from very different backgrounds at hackathons and seeing everyone work together regardless of experience or knowledge.\n\nJacky takes serious issue with the stigmas around barriers for entry at hackathons, that they are 24-hour long, caffeine-fueled build-fests with tech savants stuffed in a sweaty gym. Jacky got his footing in computer science through hackathons, and believes that the perpetuation of these ideas, that attendees need lots of prerequisite knowledge or must stay awake for the entire event, totally contradict the point of hackathons in the first place: to draw in and excite new hackers! This year, Jacky was responsible for leading logistics at the beginner-focused hackathon HackCamp. To focus the event on learning and a healthier hacker culture, the virtual conference focused on learning through workshops one day, then building and hacking the other day. This structure allowed hackers to attend workshops and learn without fear of missing out on critical build time, promotes healthy sleep schedules, and emphasizes submitting a project rather than winning. Jacky\u2019s vision for a new hackathon format was exciting and successful, with 500+ attendees, 3.2k+ livestream viewers, $1200 in donations to charities, and stellar feedback to make future hackathons more supportive to wider audiences.\n\nJacky created his favorite hackathon project at Hack the North 2020++, after learning how to work under pressure and becoming confident in his technical skills after putting ten hackathons under his belt. Jacky wanted to shoot for the moon, turning an ambitious and socially beneficial idea he had been sitting on into reality. That idea became Legist: a platform that creates simplified summaries of governmental policies in an efficient and accessible manner, with key takeaways of policies, the ability to view and filter policies by category, and even a subscription feed for policy updates.\n\nDevelopment was like a rock balancing act, with increasingly large stones in absurd positions on top of each other\u2013one small misstep could bring the project crashing down. His team coded machine learning model pipelines and GraphQL pipelines, and created many graphics and animations. The process was exhilarating, especially in the last few hours of piecing together all the moving parts. Despite the huge scope of the project, Jacky and his team were able to put together a working product that they demoed and were extremely proud to share with the world.\n\nJacky listens to a TON of music and podcasts every day. To him, everything feels so much more colorful and pop-y with a nice soundtrack to set the mood for runs in the park, doing dishes, long-transit rides, and so much more. He spent 109,535 minutes listening to music and podcasts last year, nearly 5 hours every day! Jacky also has a blog where he posts ramblings about technology, the world, and everything in-between, as well as a newsletter where he shares interesting findings from his deep dives into the internet\u2019s rabbit-holes.

    "about": "Ricardo was always interested in tech communities, events, and hackathons, and chose to pursue technology because of the positive impacts it can have in promoting social change. But when he began university, he felt lost about his tech skills and ability to create something significant that can help others. Early on in university, one of his teachers strongly suggested he participate in the UG Creativity and Innovation Contest for extra credit with another student. Ricardo had never been to a tech contest before, and he could not meet with his partner, Rodolfo Ferro (MLH Top 50 Class of 2020), as they were in different cities at the time. They worked on the project remotely and only met on the day of the contest, 15 minutes before pitching their project to judges, yet surprisingly their project won first place at the event. The experience brought Ricardo and Rodolfo together, both literally and figuratively, as they became best friends, co-founded several communities together such as Future Lab and Datostada Mx, and are now roommates! Their work together has focused on promoting science and technology through education initiatives with GitHub Campus Experts, Google Developer Groups, Microsoft Student Ambassadors, and more. Such work in the tech community has opened many opportunities for Ricardo to work on professional projects and earn scholarships, giving him important firsthand experiences that he never would have had access to otherwise.\n\nSoon after starting university, Ricardo collected a small group of students and co-founded Future Lab, a hack lab for their projects. Over 4+ years, the lab grew from a physical space at the university to a fully virtual community of 100+ members from universities all around Mexico, who have organized over 25 tech events from large hackathons of 500+ attendees to smaller and more casual meetups like MLH Local Hack Day. Much of the lab's work has involved collaborations with other organizations, such as hosting a science challenge in 2020 with Clubes de Ciencia M\u00e9xico, or receiving a grant from the Empanada Fund to develop a professional scientific computing course which will be available for free to any student in the country.\n\nRicardo is also part of an unofficial network of hackathon mentors in Mexico, where he shares and collaborates with others. Most of his work there involves co-organizing events through Future Lab; hosting workshops, talks, and conferences; and helping with dynamics in GitHub, Google, and Microsoft communities. The network has organized many events including GuanaHacks, Datostada Mx, Open Data Day, BeeHack, LinceHack, and more.\n\nTech communities and hackathons have allowed Ricardo to have a real impact in helping other students that are just as lost as he once was, and he is motivated to continue contributing to the community by putting time and effort into promoting tech as a fun field that teaches applicable skills. He has helped build a number of tech communities, but a particularly interesting one he works with now involves managing the community for Microsoft\u2019s Virtual Innovation, a free program that complements students\u2019 professional training by teaching technical skills in Industry 4.0 and Microsoft cloud technologies. The program is a part of Microsoft\u2019s Innovate for Mexico investment plan to hone industry and innovative skills for the future and has over 10,000 enrolled students from across Mexico. Ricardo is a \u201cDigital Sherpa\u201d for the program, guiding the community\u2019s learning process as inspired by sherpas who accompany travelers in achieving their journey\u2019s goals. Through the metaphor of travel, Digital Sherpas host various events such as talks on a variety of topics, live sessions with industry specialists, and hackathons for prototyping solutions, all serving to encourage students to grow and interact with each other.\n\nRicardo is an avid civic hacker and passionate professional who works to have a positive impact on society with his creations. No matter where he is or what he is working on, Ricardo says there will always be a part of him that promotes the skills and values he learned from all the hackathons he has attended because they were integral to growing his tech capabilities, connecting him with like-minded people, and shaping his tech career aspirations.\n\nBeing a part of the LGBT+ community is a defining part of Ricardo, yet he very rarely finds LGBT+ presence in Mexico\u2019s tech field. That is why he tries to promote their visibility and inclusion in projects and events that he works on, sparking conversations and bringing attention to the topic, and raising awareness about their lack of representation in important decision-making positions through his organizational work. At Open Data Day 2020, Ricardo collaborated with the Open Knowledge Foundation to use public data to map safe spaces for the community, as well as analyze the public agenda on gender and trans equality, an experience he wrote about in this blog post. Ricardo also recently joined Codeando M\u00e9xico, a non-profit and community of tech developers that focuses on civic rights, open data, and civic tech. Codeando M\u00e9xico actively promotes inclusion and human rights in the tech field, and Ricardo is proud to contribute to the organization\u2019s great work.\n\nRicardo\u2019s favorite project he built at a hackathon was CitizenBot, an intelligent bot that citizens can use to report problems or needs related to their homes and neighborhood, such as with water services, electricity, roads, and more. The bot\u2019s potential expands further beyond the individual needs of citizens, as it collects and uses the information to construct heat maps that detect potential areas in a city where there is a concentrated need for improvement, marking it as an area that would most benefit from targeted investments in resources that solve the citizens\u2019 reported needs. The hack won a first-place prize and shows the kind of civic hacking that Ricardo hopes to continue doing to help communities in need.",

    "about": "Genevieve got her first taste of the hacker community in the UCLA Ackerman ballroom. After stumbling across the sign-up page for Hackademia on Facebook, she saw an exciting new path to explore her fascination with math and science. After a little convincing, she was at her first hackathon. As she sat at a ballroom table, she started to get worried that her absolute lack of coding experience would stop her from belonging, but it only took a few people sitting at her table to make the whole thing feel accessible again.\n\nWith these new friends, she had a team that would help her with her first lines of code. They came up with a project idea: a website and app that could give users a medical diagnosis based on the input of their symptoms. They even won the Best App prize as well as Second Place Overall. After all of their hard work, Genevieve was glad that she stuck it out on her first hackathon, and not just because of the free bagels \u2014 the excitement of it all was worth it and has kept her going in the hacker community.\n\nThe hacker community didn\u2019t just help her overcome professional obstacles, but personal ones too. As a child, Genevieve had speech and language delays, something that affected her throughout her youth, even with speech therapy. The self-consciousness that she felt made it hard to feel sociable. Luckily, peers such as those that took the time to just sit at the table with Genevieve changed her viewpoint on being sociable. The collaboration of building projects and organizing projects has helped her to improve her speaking skills as well as get rid of those anxieties. She\u2019s beyond grateful that the community surrounding her passion stimulates her mentally and socially. Confidence in her speech, something she didn\u2019t see as a realistic goal, quickly became attainable.\n\nHacking has even become a family affair for Genevieve. She and her younger sister worked together at Data Day Grind hackathon to build a website with the goal of providing a resource during quarantine. She built a user interface, but it was one of her first times trying to build a website, which was a great opportunity to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. She experimented with UiPath Studio X\u2019s Data Extraction tool to acquire job listings, and also produced a data visualization of COVID-19 cases. Being able to have such an extensive learning opportunity alongside her sister made this her favorite project to date.\n\nAs a female in STEM, Genevieve has also felt the benefit of a general confidence boost. She didn\u2019t grow up learning coding, but attending hackathons made her extremely motivated to learn. Her peers encouraged her to apply for awards that she didn\u2019t feel qualified for which has led to awards such as the National Honorable Mention for Aspirations in Computing by the National Center for Women and Information Technology. Now she knows that taking that leap, even when she may not feel qualified, is always worth it.\n\nOf the three hackathons Genevieve has helped organize, two of them were virtual. The rise of virtual hackathons has allowed her to interact with incredible people from all over the world and in turn, gain a broader perspective on the diverse groups of people that share the same passion for technology as herself. The third was an in-person event, Hack SoCal 2019 \u2014 one of the first in-person high school hackathons of Southern California, where there isn\u2019t widespread access to technological education. Helloo Hacks and AI Hacks II were the two virtual events that she took part in. Her working positions were put to good use as she encouraged women to join the events in order to bridge the gender gap in technology that currently exists in the hacker landscape and shared the opportunities that she was given that meant so much to her in the past.\n\nThe ability to take part in virtual events has given her the access to technology education that she is unable to receive in her local community. Thanks to these new opportunities, she discovered the Built by Girls Mentorship program, Girls Who Code, Kode With Klossy and a CodeLabs summer internship. The Built By Girls Mentorship program has been an incredibly formative experience for Genevieve. Her first mentorship match was with a start-up Creative Director and through her sessions with them, she learned how many career opportunities were involved in the tech industry beyond programmers. Because the match was so enjoyable, she pursued other mentorship opportunities, which gave her experience with design, business and computing specializations from other women in tech. Each shared with her a similar message: the best innovators are experts who also pursue learning outside their fields.\n\nThis advice was different from the idea of specialization being the only key to success that Genevieve had believed for so long. She now understood that in order to take on the world\u2019s issues using technology, she\u2019d have to take risks and explore different paths. Genevieve explored data visualization, design, and the intersection of ethics, privacy, policy and technological innovation with this new multidisciplinary mindset. She found that this helped her grow creatively, and as a result her curiosity has advanced her problem-solving capabilities in ways she could not expect.\n\nDeveloping human-centered products in an ethical manner is important to her and she is going to uphold this curiosity as she continues to explore her career path through college. After working in the technology industry post-college, she hopes to pursue government work to create and reform public policy related to data ethics & privacy and education. Even if this is not where she ends up , she knows the skills of ideation and collaboration that she\u2019s picked up will help her to amplify the importance of these morals among her peers. This is what will help her feel that she\u2019s making a contribution to the community.\n\nSince Hack SoCal2019, it has been important to Genevieve to bring the same passion she feels for her branch of study to her local area of Los Angeles, where many schools don\u2019t have computer science curriculum or are located in underserved communities. All that she\u2019s learned from others over the years, she puts into the work to introduce more and more students to technology, like a coding workshop series she spearheaded with The Los Angeles Public Library System. Genevieve planned and manned the entire series, covering how business, programming and design factors overlapped to produce useful websites.\n\nAlready, she has been able to emphasize an interdisciplinary approach to learning in her community. Professionals from tech start-ups, as well as from major companies like Apple and Tesla, joined the workshops to help students recognize just how much went into the tech industry beyond software development. Genevieve is immensely grateful for her experience with hackathons, and she hopes to use all that she learned from them to continue this form of outreach into the future.",

    "website": "",
    "about": "Yashika is grateful to her family for supporting her pursuit of a career in technology, as the vast majority of women in India are not able to pursue what they want, typically being pressured into other fields however we have recently seen positive cultural shifts. She was first interested in computer science engineering only as a means of joining India\u2019s defensive Air Force, as women could only get into defense through a technical degree, but a genuine love for computer science developed as she found supportive tech communities. Despite supporting her dreams, her family was unable to get her the two years of formal coaching needed to attend India\u2019s tier 1 engineering universities which are predominantly male attended. Yashika's family supported her emotionally, and from studying books on her own she managed to get into and attend a tier 3 university. Indian universities don\u2019t have majors, instead, Yashika learned about a variety of topics such as electrical engineering, chemistry, and physics. Barely 25% of students in her classes were womxn and their lacking presence in tech made her feel lost at a time when she needed guidance and mentorship, so Yashika searched for fellow women among the few local tech communities and found the Women Who Code Python club. The club was where she first focused on and found her passion for computer science, as they helped her learn hard coding concepts in an easy way\n\nOn top of learning about CS, the club also helped Yashika start to break down the barriers she had been facing as a woman in tech, starting with a fear of public speaking. Yashika could sit and listen to people talk for hours but would faint if someone even so much as called her name from the stage\u2014her fears even stopped her from going to club meetings for a while. Yashika always wished she could jump onto the stage and start speaking, but she was too afraid to try such a bold move. One day she heard a piece of advice, that technical skills are replaceable while soft skills are not, and that made her think hard about giving herself the chance to speak. She asked the Women Who Code Python leaders if she could lead a webinar on NumPy and they said yes, and so she prepared for the event on her own with no real ideas about content length and structure. Delivering the webinar, Yashika lost track of time and went over by 20 minutes, leaving her with no time to answer questions or interact with the audience. She was unhappy with herself because the webinar became less interactive the more she talked, but she was also extremely happy that she talked the whole time and that people stayed and enjoyed the entire session. This was the first of many talks Yashika would come to deliver, and she has since gained enough experience to confidently lead any webinar, conference, or meetup.\n\nBy the end of her third year at university, Yashika had joined Omdena as a Machine Learning Engineer, a collaborative coding community for building social-good projects. Omdena showed her the power that a single line of code could have, building projects that saved lives, lowered suicide rates, and decreased teenage crimes; her code made tangible contributions to the world, and having such an impact became her passion in pursuing CS.\n\nYashika was planning to spend the summer at a CS internship in Pennsylvania when COVID-19 hit. The program was canceled, but in searching for other opportunities Yashika found the MLH Fellowship, applied, and got in! She found the diverse tech community she had always been looking for at MLH, as they made coding a community-based effort by providing her with help, resources, and a positive environment to grow in. The Fellowship helped Yashika gain the skills and experience to contribute to open source, and the experience helped her become who she is today by boosting her confidence and strengthening her toolset. None of her prior internships or community experiences felt as welcoming and supportive as MLH, and so Yashika was incredibly excited after the Fellowship when MLH reached out to invite her back as a Pod Leader. The experience was amazing, as Yashika learned so much about a wide variety of topics by helping Fellows brainstorm and work on their passion projects. Yashika\u2019s job was to ensure that no Fellow was struggling, helping them structure their work and have a good experience, while also honing valuable leadership and organizational skills useful for her future engineering career. She loved her coworkers and the supportive environment of MLH, and is glad to have helped her Fellows gain internships and jobs after the program. Yashika is so grateful for the experience because it helped her feel more confident about not only her tech skills but also her professional and project management skills that she will use in future jobs.\n\nEverything Yashika knows about programming she has learned from communities, mentors, and others in tech who generously invested their time to help uplift newcomers and underrepresented groups in tech. After a year of learning from Women Who Code Python, she became a leader in the group and worked to give back to the community in the same way she was helped through her first year. She also started and led her own machine learning study group to uplift women in tech, where she helped teach enthusiastic women of all ages. The experience of leading a study group led Yashika to pursue more mentoring and public speaking opportunities, giving talks and over 10 webinars in one summer. Yashika also launched NLP and deep-learning, and \u201cAce technical interviews with Python\u201d study groups with the same intentions of spreading knowledge and creating supportive communities, both successful experiences that reached a diverse group of attendees. She now hosts a monthly Ask Me Anything series where she invites brilliant industry-leading women to talk about their inspirational experiences in tech\u2014listeners often tell Yashika how the talks helped them choose the right paths for their own careers. Communities matter a lot to Yashika, and they are one of few ways to find help in pursuing your own path in India. Even with a supportive family like Yashika has, if they don\u2019t know about your chosen field or understand your work it can still be very hard to forge your own path, which is why the support of tech communities is so important. Yashika wants to see more women join the STEM fields to make a more inclusive environment for female hackers in India.\n\nEvery hackathon Yashika attends lets her add a new tool to her tech stack. When she began learning computer science she only had theoretical knowledge, but by building projects at hackathons she got the chance to get her hands dirty and apply her ideas and theories to create a product. Building projects in a limited time span has helped her come up with ideas quickly and stay motivated to finish what she has started. The mentors and other hackers that she meets at events help her improve and stay motivated to keep refining her skills and build a tech repertoire. The connections and network she has forged inspire her and helped her find her career path in machine learning and AI when she felt lost pursuing a variety of tech interests, and they will certainly remain helpful as she pursues her future career.\n\nYashika is proud of the projects she has made at hackathons and the social good projects she has built. The project she is most proud of is the #sexedPL project, where she used data science to analyze the effects of sex education to reduce teenage crimes, pregnancies, and suicides. She used machine learning and natural language processing to analyze social media posts on multiple platforms to understand what happens in the mind of teenagers. The analysis from the project and report she put together revealed that kids struggle to get the basic sex education that they need and are choose wrong or dangerous behaviors because of that. The report went on to be presented by the community, Omdena, in front of lawmakers of the Poland,\u00a0 and as a result, they are considering enforcing sex education as a mandatory subject in schools.\n\nComing from a point where she felt lost and without a community to where she can now build an array of projects and help other lost individuals in the hacker community to learn and feel at home, Yashika is proud that she never gave up. She thanks the MLH, Omdena, and Women Who Code Python communities for giving her a chance to meet people like herself in tech, for helping her learn through experience, and for helping her grow into the person she is today.",

    "about": "Joining a hackathon was a calculated risk for Elias. He had taken a few computer science courses in high school, but most of his artistic drive was focused on graphic design and music production. So when a friend invited Elias to participate in MLH during his second semester at UTSA, he used what he knew from these passions to create a unique project with his team. He created three full-length tracks of music and over a dozen sound effects and sprites to be put to use in what became a first place award for him and his teammates. Since his first hackathon, Elias has taken initiative to bring his passions to networking efforts and future hackathons, where he can now sufficiently hold his own.\n\nAs a student, it\u2019s easy to spread yourself too thin. After an especially strenuous freshman year, Elias recognized that he needed to take a step back and cut down on stress. Hackathons turned out to be the perfect solution, a noncommittal outlet for creativity with a clear end in sight that could advance his portfolio. These compartmentalized events took him out of the usual grind of his degree path while finding a new energy in the world of hacking by encouraging him to better himself. This relief gave him peace of mind and an even wider pool of experiences to draw from as a multidisciplinary student.\n\nIn order to build confidence in his individual abilities, Elias started submitting solo projects on Devpost, one of which became a quick favorite of his: Carl, Defender of Waves. With no pressure to follow a certain set of guidelines, Elias used this passion project to focus on perfecting small functionalities within the game. Working on Carl was a great reminder of how rewarding taking fun, creative ventures can be, even within a professional setting. He brings the important lessons that he learns during solo projects to the table when working in larger group settings like hackathons.\n\nThough Elias is a Pre-Law student, studying Politics with a minor in Music Technology, he greatly appreciates the value of outside experiences, whether artistic or scientific. As a law student, you are often expected to solve situations where you must analyze and defend elements of a variety of different fields in a court of law. As the technological world becomes more and more present in all of our lives, lawyers with an advanced understanding of computer science and cybersecurity have an edge. Knowing that the field is changing, Elias has built up his experience with programming to better equip himself with the knowledge necessary to argue forensic situations relating to computational data. Along with a greater understanding of issues that can be brought to experienced clients and translating what he knows along the way, Elias is well-equipped to traverse the workplace.",

    "about": "While preparing to study abroad at Western University in Canada, Jacklyn stumbled upon MLH\u2019s website. She knew what hackathons were but had never attended one before, so on a whim and with hopes of traveling to new places, she applied and got accepted to attend Hack the North. After flying out, Jacklyn spent her first weekend abroad on a bus with 30 other hackers en route to her first hackathon. It was there she found a welcoming community of peers who she related to and enjoyed spending time with, and forged friendships that she maintains to this day.\n\nThe sheer size and amount of opportunity at Hack the North amazed Jacklyn. With her first team, she created Cookie Craver: Cookie Clicker which used internet cookies. Despite the project not winning any prizes, she left the event with more swag than she could carry, and knew she wanted to attend more events. The next weekend, she attended GrizzHacks and found a smaller, more intimate, and just as friendly community. Here, she teamed up with several hackers including high schooler Nathan Dimmer, and their project won three awards. Jacklyn noted the extreme satisfaction she felt watching the high-schooler come in with no coding experience and leave having made a website. After these two events, Jacklyn spent most weekends attending hackathons and always had a great time. She notes that \u201cwhat ultimately began on a whim has dramatically changed my life, and I\u2019m really grateful for that.\u201d\n\nAt UrbanHacks 2018, Jacklyn worked on a team with two high schoolers and one middle schooler to create her favorite project, GeoHam. Aside from the project winning first place at the event, GeoHam is truly her favorite project because of her experience in mentorship and the visible growth she spurred in her younger peers: with no prior website development experience, they learned in one night how to deploy a database and populate it with data. This experience provided invaluable lessons in teaching and mentorship for Jacklyn. The team eventually met with the Chief Digital Officer of Hamilton to present GeoHam as they believed the project could have a positive impact on the community. Creating a project with a real impact was extremely rewarding to Jacklyn, and working with the younger hackers taught her a lot about teaching and mentorship\u2014skills she would continue to practice as a mentor and organizer at many more events.\n\nThe many hackathons Jacklyn attended helped her hone critical software development skills and communication skills that she feels were not targeted in her university curriculum. The experience of building hackathon projects helped her learn core principles about how to properly develop and deploy a stable project, and learning to work with new teammates helped her improve at thinking on the fly and made her a valuable MLH Coach and event organizing team member. Jacklyn has coached over 30 events, hosted and written Localhost workshops and technical livestreams, been extremely involved in Local Hack Day, and helped train new generations of Coaches. As an MLH Coach, she created MLH\u2019s Intro to Python series on YouTube, singlehandedly writing, presenting, producing, and editing the entire series. Her work paid off, as the series has helped empower thousands of hackers by teaching them basic technology skills.\n\nAttending hackathons has also led Jacklyn to job opportunities abroad. She had met members of RBC\u2019s team at various hackathons, and they invited her to interview for their Amplify program\u2014a three month long internal hackathon and innovation program. Ultimately, Jacklyn was offered a full-time job at RBC in Canada and accepted the position. Jacklyn has continued to be a Coach at MLH, finding further opportunities to travel, meet and work with amazing people through the hacker community.\n\nJacklyn was the lead organizer of Hack Quarantine, MLH\u2019s first-ever digital member event. The three-week-long hackathon was planned meticulously over ten days, making way for over 3,500 hackers to participate in a time where COVID-19 makes traditional hackathons impossible. She found organizing the event exhausting but extremely rewarding, as hackers from across six continents were drawn to the event\u2019s 24/7 educational livestream, and built projects that they believed in. To help pull the event together, Jacklyn brought together hackathon organizers, including Will Russell, from across the UK, Canada, and the USA, and partnered with communities from as far as the Middle East. Her work certainly paid off as the event garnered hundreds of thousands of views on the livestream. Before COVID-19, Jacklyn would regularly travel to mentor at various hackathons such as Royal Hackaway and DurHack, and as an MLH Coach, she supported member events and Hosted by MLH Events in their transition to digital.\n\nJacklyn ultimately received a Diana Award, the \u201cthe most prestigious accolade a young person aged 9-25 years can receive for their social action or humanitarian work\u201d for her work supporting hackathons and organizing Hack Quarantine after being nominated by Aaron Osher - a fellow Coach and Hackathons UK Director.\n\nBy attending, organizing, and Coaching at hackathons Jacklyn has amassed a huge amount of experience as a communicative and skilled hacker, and she continues to pay her experience forward into the hacker community. She has given back to the hacker community by founding and leading Hack Quarantine to create tens of hours of educational content online and a virtual community, supporting the smaller European hackathon scene, Coaching and giving hands-on support at large events, and cultivating beginner-oriented Discord and social media communities with Local Hack Day: Build, Local Hack Day: Share, and INIT.\n\nWhat started as a meme about a stuffed shark from IKEA eventually turned into BLAHAJGang, an extremely supportive community of over 600 hackers that Jacklyn leads. BLAHAJGang is the largest guild on the Local Hack Day leaderboards, and won Local Hack Day: Share with 15,000 points, 4000 points above 2nd place. They now sit at #4 on the Local Hack Day activity leaderboards, and you can ask more about where Jacklyn plans to take the group on her random tech Twitch streams at twitch.tv/JacklynBiggin.",

    "about": "Programming did not come easy to Shivay for a long time, as he often struggled to write basic codes while students in his classes won programming competitions and hackathons. He was intrigued by the concept of hackathons, building a project within 1-2 days and meeting like-minded people, so he helped organize HackDTU 2018, but yet he struggled to attend events as a hacker. He tried to build teams to attend hackathons with, yet they always fell through, and in the process of organizing HackDTU he felt left out and not worthy of the work he was doing, as if such events were beyond his grasp and abilities. This dilemma continued until his third year at university, when he decided to make a change and work on himself in terms of visibility, activity, making extra efforts to improve programming and development skills, and getting help from his seniors. By the end of the year, Shivay was finally accepted to attend his first hackathon as a participant, where he teamed up with first-year students that were also new to hackathons. From ideation to actually coding, the hackathon experience was intriguing and fun for Shivay as he focused not on the result of his project but on the experience of attending that he had long sought after. His team ended up winning a first place prize, which marked the breaking point for all of his success to come. After years of wanting to attend hackathons yet feeling unworthy of doing so, Shivay\u2019s first hackathon showed him that fear has no place at such events, only joy and excitement to learn new things and meet new people, and that it is never too late to start something new.\n\nShivay attended over 70 events since then as a participant, mentor, judge, and organizer, winning at 28 events and coming top 15 at most others, including HackMIT, HackTech, Thoughtworks Hackathon, and HackZurich. Learning new technologies, practicing the ideation and pitching of a product, and networking with other hackers has opened so many doors in life for Shivay, from internship opportunities to teaching life skills, that it\u2019s hard for him to even acknowledge them all. As he attended and won more hackathons, Shivay realized the importance of making products that impact the lives of real people. and he wanted to help others at hackathons find the same growth and success he had found. He realized the importance of guiding new hackers as they learn, improve their skills, and create their own social benefit projects, so he became a mentor at various international hackathons including QWER Hackathon at UCLA for the LGBTQ+ community, LA Hacks, and Innovation Cup in FUTO Nigeria. Shivay hopes to help empower members of the hacker community, as he shows by example that it is never too late to start improving oneself, learn to code, or have a positive impact on the world. Aside from mentoring, Shivay has dedicated his time in 2020 and onwards to giving back to the hacker community through organizing events, hosting free speaker sessions at Code For Cause, Singh in USA, Coding Blocks, and more that reached over 100,000 people, appearances on podcasts, helping create YouTube content for hackathons, and working as a Fellow in the MLH Fellowship program Explorer Pod.\n\nAn event organizer helps define how hackathons function, identifies what they want hackers to learn from the experience, and figure out how to help them do so. Whether working on a variety of workshops, hackathon events, or speaker sessions, Shivay finds organizing to be a great way to leave an impact on both first-time and seasoned hackers and give them the same great experiences that he had at his first event and beyond. He enjoys helping newcomers get the important guidance that they need to maneuver hackathons and have a good time, and he also helps organizing team members understand the dynamics of putting a hackathon together regarding hosting, creating judging criteria, finding good prizes, and more. He has organized in-person events for HackMAIT, HackDTU, and HackGTBIT, as well as virtual events for HackOn, and The Python Week, with events ranging from 400 to over 3000 attendees. Shivay\u2019s particular contributions tend to focus on honing an atmosphere of learning, sharing, and displaying skills, and hearing positive feedback from attendees motivates him to keep giving back to the community and ensures he is doing what he can to help attendees feel comfortable and have fun. Shivay has also mentored and spoken at over 25 hackathons that he helped organize, and in performing these different roles he gets to help students find inspiration to make amazing projects that change the world one piece at a time.\n\nThe MLH Fellowship was one of Shivay\u2019s favorite experiences in the hacker community and he had so much fun as he learned and collaborated with other Fellows. He had applied to Batch 0 of the program but was rejected because of the poor internet and audio quality which would hinder his contributions to the program. He was understandably upset, but it taught him that he had to not only prepare himself but his environment for future interviews. When Batch 1 of the MLH Fellowship was announced, Shivay was excited about the new programs that it offered and applied again, this time better prepared in every sense. He ended up being selected for the MLH Fellowship Explorer Track, which turned out to be the best experience of his life.\n\nThe structure of the MLH Explorer track was unique and intuitive, featuring 6 hackathon sprints of different themes that each lasted 2 weeks, filling the 3-month program with deep dives into a variety of hackathon projects. With a focus on collaborative learning, teams had ample time to learn and teach each other new tech stacks, workflows, and video editing skills. Being able to commit more time to each project made the inclusive environment of hackathons even more amplified through fun and effective teamwork, guidance from pod leaders, and support from mentors. Collaborating through group and paired programming sessions brought Shivay closer to the other Fellows, while the positive and inclusive environment let them create 6 amazing and empowering projects. Over the course of the 12 weeks, Shivay gained a new perspective towards learning, helping him think outside the box while approaching problems and solutions in a variety of ways. The Fellowship was an amazing learning experience guided by a shared passion for hacking, and Shivay pays the experience forward every time he organizes, mentors, and attends hackathons, empowering and helping others through the hacker community.\n\nShivay was inspired to create his favorite hackathon project by a visit to a blind school, as he noticed the difficulties the students faced when using the talk-back feature on their phones with braille boards. 289 million people are visually impaired, 33 million are completely blind, and 1/3 of the global blind population is in India. Braille boards are a common tool for the visually impaired in India to write and communicate with others, yet the boards are expensive and bulky, meaning that many are unable to own or use braille boards. Shivay wanted to help solve this problem by creating a smaller braille board that is cheap, easy to access, and globally available for those in need. With his team at PainIIT\u2019s Solve4Bharat Hackathon, Shivay planned to make a braille board that can be used to efficiently type sentences, communicate with others, play games, and even code. The project used an Arduino nano and tact buttons in an IoT device to receive braille inputs from a visually impaired person that are then sent to the user\u2019s phone, where a paired Android app would read inputs out loud so users can engage with their inputs however they need. Machine learning was implemented in the app to predict the users\u2019 words and help speed up the input process. The project was hugely successful, winning first at the event and earning a top 10 ranking at the nationwide Google Build for Digital India contest, but Shivay is mostly proud of the project because it is actively used by visually impaired students and at blind schools in India. Having a positive impact on the world and helping those in need are driving forces in Shivay\u2019s passion for programming.\n\nTechnology has the power to change anyone\u2019s life, and it certainly has changed Shivay\u2019s. Using tech for himself he has been able to learn, grow, and implement skills to real-world problems, and by sharing tech with others he has helped inspire many in his region to find similar growth. Tech allowed him to empower himself, the underrepresented peoples of the world through projects, and others in their journey to find inspiration in improving society. All the skills that the hacker community teaches can also be honed through giving back to the very same community, a fulfilling and fun way to practice a diverse array of skills while making meaningful contributions to the community. Shivay is who he is today with the help of hackathons, and he will be forever grateful for focusing on his hacker journey as it helped him grow his skills and sense of self, let him make an impact on greater society, and gave him a platform to further empower members of the hacker community.",

    "about": "When not in class, Alexis is usually found in her school\u2019s basement, tinkering away in the robotics lab. Her robotics community introduced her to hackathons and convinced her to attend HackMann in New York City. Upon entering the venue, Alexis realized that she was one of only four women at the entire event. Creating an all-women team, Alexis and her peers created a bot that used an AI algorithm to flag common terms or phrases used to sexually harass gamers on Discord servers. Alexis and her team were initially unfazed by the other male competitors, but upon presenting their project and seeing some snide laughter from others, Alexis felt a wave of intense anger that she will never forget. Despite the lack of respect from peers, the project won 3rd place at the event, and the experience was pivotal not only in her obsession with building a better world through technical product creation, but also in motivating her passion to make hackathons a more welcoming environment for gender minorities. Alexis continues to attend hackathons, and even co-organized a virtual HackMann event last summer, reaching over 150 high school and middle school students from around the world.\n\nAlexis repeatedly wondered why she had an experience at her first hackathon that discouraged her from pursuing hackathons and even a future in tech. Her best answer was that the problem is structural: most hackathons are attended by men, planned by men, and cater to a male-dominated field. From this conclusion, she saw the potential to turn hackathons into an avenue for increasing diversity in tech\u2014to revolutionize the hackathon space and create an accessible, encouraging pathway into tech for underrepresented minorities. It will take the dedicated work of driven individuals to reshape hackathon spaces, and Alexis believes she is one of them.\n\nAt hackathons, Alexis has worked with people she had never met before from different cultures around the world, allowing her to share her diversity with others and learn how to navigate collaborating with people from different backgrounds. As an aspiring AI researcher, Alexis notes such collaborative skills are imperative to developing fair and unbiased algorithms, and she hopes for a future where technical developers represent and support the diversity of our world. Alexis hopes to continue working in hackathon spaces so that MLH diversity reports reveal not only improvement in female and gender-minority attendance, but parity.\n\nKnowing the potential benefits of such work and wanting to continue fighting discrimination in tech, Alexis co-founded weSTEM, an impact-driven startup dedicated to building the next generation of diverse tech developers, and founded Creatica, New York City\u2019s first virtual hackathon for women and non-binary individuals in high-school and university.\n\nWhile technological advancements push humanity forward, Alexis finds that it simultaneously widens existing inequities. She is especially interested in this dynamic for the future of AI, and how the lack of diverse representation in technology spaces can perpetuate discrimination and social inequity. While interning at Girls Who Code, Alexis researched the tangible impact that a lack of diversity has on technology spaces. She found data that suggests a lack of high school computer science education impacts the lack of representation in tech industries. Her most important finding was that AI systems can perpetuate biases based on gender or race, and can potentially be used to wrongfully justify racism through flawed, yet supposedly \u201cobjective,\u201d technology. COMPAS is an AI tool for assessing criminal sentencing lengths, and is inherently biased, as it incorrectly labels Black defendants as future criminals at near twice the rate as white defendants. Such biased algorithms serve to cement discrimination into vital social structures, and are a great danger to the future of society. Alexis sees part of the solution to such problems as including more diverse developers who are aware of such biases that may be unconsciously integrated during the development cycle. weSTEM is Alexis\u2019 attempt to fight and prevent a future defined by algorithmic bias by raising awareness and promoting developer diversity. Ultimately, she hopes to contribute to a future in which developers reflect the diversity of the world around us.\n\nweSTEM has two sectors: impact and product. Impact initiatives focus on increasing accessibility to tech, and have directly impacted over 800 individuals around the world through a number of means. Some events include hosting TECHforALL, raising over $10,000 to provide 47 laptops to students in need, hosting after-school programs to teach girls around the Bronx coding fundamentals, and collaborating with Alexis\u2019 high school to host an all-day virtual conference with panels of prominent women in tech for a global audience of over 200. weSTEM also has fellowships, with 7 fellows from 3 countries who teach free computer science workshops virtually for young women and non-binary individuals, having reached over 100 people so far. The product sector of weSTEM is its online community product, a centralized platform where young women can find tangible tech opportunities, from hackathons to scholarships to internships. The product sector is weSTEM\u2019s current focus, and it is expanding internationally by partnering with hackathons abroad. While weSTEM is still in its early stages, its work has been recognized by the National Center for Women in Information Technology (NCWIT), the White House\u2019s CSforALL, and Stanford\u2019s she++ #include fellowship.\n\nAfter talking with experienced organizers at gender-focused hackathons, Alexis assembled a team to bring Creatica to life\u2014a hackathon hosted by weSTEM for young women around the world to build and innovate new technical products. She wanted to create an all-female hackathon space so that young women and non-binary individuals could have a different first hackathon experience than her own, contributing to a new, more diverse generation of tech. Alexis\u2019s vision led to tangible impact, hosting an event with 8 workshops and tech talks, 8 challenges and prize tracks, and over 35 mentors. Creatica 2020 reached 456 hackers from over 18 countries, with 63% of attendees being first-time hackers. Alexis is excited for the future of Creatica, as it will continue annually, and planning for Creatica 2021 is already underway.\n\nThe many women of different ages and aspirations Alexis has met at hackathons have changed her life, shifting her perspective on both her own and the world\u2019s future. Alexis heard unforgettable journeys from those who found success and power in the tech world despite being widely underrepresented in it, empowering her to pursue a future in tech. These stories expanded notions of her own identity, as she realized that her diversity is power, especially in planning and developing technical products. Alexis found warmth and support among the organizers of gender-focused hackathons: she learned the essential framework of organizing a gender-focused hackathon from the co-founder of WEHack UTD Medha; received ample support and advice from the executive director of TechTogether Fiona; and found structural and personal support from the MLH team that was instrumental in founding and organizing Creatica. Hackathons and the hackathon community changed Alexis\u2019 perception of her own identity and aspirations and make her hopeful for the future, as she sees young hackers around the world passionate about building technical products for social impact.\n\nAlexis\u2019 favorite hackathon project was building Liveify, a web app that generates concerts or personalized Spotify playlists of live-performed songs based on the user\u2019s preferences. Liveify was inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic putting the entertainment industry on hold, making it impossible for an artists\u2019 fans to immerse themselves in a live concert experience. Working on this project was very interesting, as Alexis saw how it could easily scale up into a startup and successful product for entertainment in the time of a pandemic with virtual reality implementation. Virtual concert attendees could be deeply immersed in a concert experience, receiving merchandise and a VR headset with their tickets, and watching a live concert with other virtual attendees. Such an experience could be amazing for consumers, as well as help artists earn revenue in an otherwise stagnant time. Alexis found that some companies are trying to pull off this exact idea, but that the technical, virtual reality piece is challenging to maintain alongside user comfort; nevertheless, she loved the creativity and ingenuity of her project\u2019s ideation phase, thinking about how to extend a hack into something usable and impactful for users around the world.",

    "about": "Emily is the founder of San Diego\u2019s largest technology organization - ACM at UC San Diego. What started as a team of six students (all prior hackathon teammates of hers) grew into a huge network with 30 officers, hosting over 130 workshops for more than 5,000 attendees. The organization has over 1,500 members and is now composed of four child organizations that focus on different tech fields: AI, Cybersecurity, Entrepreneurship, and Software Engineering. ACM has promoted its members to attend hackathons, many for their first time, and in one year won enough prizes at hackathons to improve the school\u2019s MLH ranking from position 30 to 15. ACM also helps its members prepare for interviews, and they have found success at companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Tesla, and Microsoft. The massive community that Emily created and helped blossom serves to unite computer science, engineering, design, and business students on her campus, and helps them all find success in the promising future of technology.\n\nComing out as transgender to her family was a difficult experience for Emily.\u00a0 Her aunt even told her that she would lose all respect in school and never find a job after college. It exacerbated her fears about being an LGBTQIA+ woman in the engineering industry, where the acceptance of such groups is unfortunately still an issue; however, being a member of technology communities actually helped her break out of her shell and encouraged her to be herself. She recalls attending her first woman-centric hackathon, HackXX at UC San Diego in Spring 2018, and being amazed at all the women\u2013both cis and trans\u2013working passionately on projects that promote gender diversity. Later that year she attended IEEE Future Leaders Forum in Texas, and after initially introducing herself with her dead name, organizers helped by giving her a new badge with her true name. She describes all the attendees as supportive, caring, and accepting, and through hackathons, she found a community where she could be totally accepted as herself. Attending many hackathons and conferences has made Emily hopeful that one day technological communities will be able to solve diversity issues and increase diversity in the field. Organizations such as ACM-W and Society of Women Engineers, and hackathons such as AthenaHacks and TechTogether also do amazing work that has changed Emily\u2019s life, and she notes that feeling so welcomed in hacker communities made it much easier for her to accept herself.\n\nEmily first started hacking at SB Hacks in 2018 after learning about hackathons from a club. She signed up expecting to spend the event hacking by herself, but on the shuttle ride to the event, a landslide caused a massive car crash, resulting in an 8-hour detour for her and the other hackers. This experience changed her life, as she found herself bonding with the other attendees and made several strong friendships. Feeling like a part of a community when she had no such expectations got Emily hooked on hackathons, and she has since attended over twenty events, making new friends at every single one.\n\nEmily went into this first hackathon with only HTML and CSS knowledge, and at each event, she focused on learning and honing just one new skill with the help of mentors and teammates. This helped her learn JavaScript, then Node.js, and React over several hackathons. These skills prepared her for internships, the networking at events helped her get interviews, and the hacks she worked on impressed her interviewers. Going to hackathons and becoming a part of the community helped Emily develop all the experience she needed to land two internships at Google, and even a full-time job there as a Software Engineer.\n\nWhile hackathons in the COVID era may seem like an unknown quantity, Emily had her favorite experience at the fully remote Citrus Hack 2021 hackathon. With a remote team, Emily built Move.it, an AI and math-based web application to help users create their perfect workout. In this project, her team combined React, WebRTC, Tensorflow, Node.js, and many more technologies to create a video call platform that detects, compares, and grades users' exercises. The project won 1st Place Overall at the hackathon.",

    "about": "In another life without the hacker community, Hugo would be applying to law school right now. He attended his first hackathon Hack TJ, a local event for high school students, without knowing anyone inside, yet upon walking into the venue with his oversized sleeping bag he instantly thought, \u201cthese are my people.\u201d Before learning of the hacker community, Hugo viewed tech as a boring and \u201cweird\u201d industry, but he quickly realized that hackathons embody the best of the technology community: innovative, risk-taking, dedicated, and passionate people who build things out of love rather than for money. He had planned on studying history and philosophy at university to pursue law, but his experiences at Hack TJ, PennApps, MHacks, and more changed this vision for him, and he instead declared computer science and philosophy majors.\n\nHugo sat down in the Hack TJ auditorium next to a stranger who would come to be his teammate and great friend, Liam. Hugo\u2019s team built a hack that gave \u201cgrades\u201d to representatives in congress based on how well they interact with their constituents on social media. The project ended up winning the Best Civic Technology App prize, and the COO of the prize\u2019s corporate sponsor was so impressed with the hack that they offered the team a summer internship to keep working on it. Hugo loves hackathons because they provide an unparalleled space to innovate and test new ideas without fear of failure alongside many other interesting and creative students from across the globe. The project eventually turned into FeedScore, and the team even demoed it at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the largest technology exhibition in the world! FeedScore analyzes millions of social media posts using a proprietary sentiment analysis algorithm in order to provide real-time insights about public opinions regarding various political issues. Hack TJ sparked Hugo\u2019s interest in technology and hackathons, and if he had never sat down next to Liam then he probably would not be working in tech today.\n\nAn example of innovation that jumped to Hugo\u2019s mind was at PennApps in winter 2018. Hugo\u2019s team wanted to build an augmented reality drone racing hack (like Mario Kart with first-person drones and courses made from augmented reality objects), but after several hours of work, heavy rain settled in and any work involving drones was suddenly impossible. Team morale was low as they scrapped the project and started to think of a new idea, but after taking time to breathe and focus, they pivoted to something that could leverage their existing work to a similar end: an augmented reality car racing hack, DeREZ. DeREZ combined the thrill of first-person view car racing with the power of augmented reality, and they were able to render an augmented reality racing course for an RC car, visible through an Oculus Rift. The team stayed calm and tight-knit through the rest of the development, which made a much more tangible difference in their results than their technical competence. They had a ton of fun and learned a lot about persistence and creativity in rolling with the punches.\n\nHugo\u2019s professional aspirations intersect product management and software development, and he believes the future of product teams will involve contributors with balanced understandings of both technical aptitude and product awareness, instead of current assembly-line models with specialized individual contributors. He has strong product management skills in product ideation, UX strategy, and market positioning, but also a high level of technical competency. The best product managers he has worked with were former engineers with a well-rounded view of both engineering and business perspectives. Hackathons have allowed Hugo to explore both pathways, being a product manager for some projects and an engineer for others. Hugo hopes to one day leverage the experiences he has gained at hackathons to lead his own product team.\n\nAt PennApps XIX, Hugo created his favorite hack: jobFAIR. Hugo was inspired by a recent article that exposed how Amazon\u2019s internal recruiting tool was biased against female and minority applicants because the algorithm was trained with a majority of white male engineering applicants. JobFAIR is an alternative hiring solution, providing interview recommendations to HR personnel by training a machine learning algorithm on past interview data while using a reweighting algorithm that mitigates bias against applicants from underrepresented backgrounds. Hugo was also inspired by his own experiences in tough job selection processes, and he wants to ensure that each applicant has a fair and unbiased chance at being selected, with hiring decisions made based on talent and not a biased algorithm. On top of building the frontend admin interface in Vue.js, he handled product management for the hack: concept ideation, user research, and crafting the value proposition. This was his first hackathon project that delved deep into data science and the first one where he didn\u2019t use hardware\u2014he wanted a challenge to explore outside his comfort zone. JobFAIR won the AI/ML prize and claimed 3rd place at the event.\n\nIn 2020, Hugo helped organize Technica, the largest hackathon in the world for women and non-binary individuals. As part of Technica, Hugo led the development of a custom virtual hackathon platform for the event, as the pandemic left them unable to host in person. After evaluating dozens of existing options, the team realized that conventional virtual event solutions were not made for hackathons and could not replicate the magical in-person experience for an online event\u2014so they built their own platform.\n\nIn just four months of development, the Technica virtual platform created a world-class virtual event experience for hackathon attendees, leveraging technology solutions such as Zoom, Slack, Twilio, and Intercom. The system includes an intuitive registration and login system, an embedded schedule, and support for dozens of virtual workshops, games, and meetups. The platform also provides completely custom hackathon-specific features such as seamless mentorship requests, a custom sponsorship fair, and multiple dedicated virtual spaces for hackers to collaborate.\n\nTechnica virtual platform was tested at two partnered hackathons before being used at Technica. The platform was immensely successful at each event, working as expected with thousands of concurrently active users, and Hugo\u2019s team received numerous compliments from hackers, mentors, and sponsors about the quality of the experience and how easy the platform was to use. Due to the success of Technica and the growing need for a viable virtual event platform in the hackathon community, Hugo\u2019s team has received dozens of inquiries from other hackathons and corporate sponsors about using the platform for their events, and they are working to share the platform with the entire hackathon community.\n\nHugo is excited to expand the work he has done with Technica through 2021, as he assumes the new role of co-executive director of the organization with the mission of building the preeminent brand in the world to promote gender diversity in tech and beyond. He hopes to develop more innovative products and initiatives to usher in a new chapter of Technica\u2019s growth and sustainability, one where they reduce reliance on corporate sponsorships and instead fund the organization through licensing products such as the platform.\n\nThe construction of this platform should demonstrate to the hacker community that when you see a problem, you should have the courage to try and solve it, even when others say it is too risky or challenging. Many team members told Hugo that what they were planning was crazy\u2014how could a team of students build such a complex and demanding product in a short time with a limited budget? The reality is that hackers have much more potential than they think, and sometimes it just takes the guts to act on it and go against conventional thinking in order to achieve success and build a better community for everyone.",

    "about": "Naman entered his first hackathon when he was only a sophomore in high school. Knowledgeable of the age range of typical attendees, he felt daunted by the idea of not building anything of value. But, by the time VTHacks was up, he had learned so much in only 36 hours. He had a finished mobile game by the end, which he published to the app store. The game was a hit among his friends, Naman\u2019s first glimpse into the impact of a hacker. He became obsessed with hackathons, enrolling whenever he could and building bigger and bigger projects. He remains a storied vet of every VTHacks event since 2015 and he\u2019s got no plan to stop. His combined app downloads add up to over 3,000, and he\u2019s amassed 80,000 users on his websites.\n\nDuring a break between VTHacks events, Naman entered HackUVA at the University of Virginia during his senior year of high school. With two years of competitive hacking to bring to the table, he built DrawPlatformer, an app that converts hand-drawn pictures into a platformer video game map. The game was a hit among the fellow hackers. Attendees crowded around the table and fought for markers to have a chance to build their own map and play online. DrawPlatformer won first place, giving Naman the confidence he needed to zoom through future events while taking time to enjoy himself.\n\nThe community that Naman was now fully a part of opened his eyes to how much impact one person can make with technological knowledge. The valuable skill of hacking under pressure becomes a totally new important skill when applied to real-world issues. For instance, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, he saw a lot of his friends face hardship as more and more job opportunities were lost. Seeing the work that his peers put into their passions go seemingly unnoticed inspired Naman to build and launch MassApply, a job searching tool that helps students discover actively hiring tech companies, contact verified recruiters, and manage their job applications.\n\nJust two weeks after the MassApply launch, a stranger reached out to Naman. They thanked him for providing the service that led to them landing an interview and their first ever job offer.\u00a0 The support was overwhelming, assisting over 10,000 students with their job searches. From then on, Naman knew how powerful of a tool hacking was for making a positive impact.\u00a0 Because MassApply took off in the way that it has, Naman has focused his mission on dedicating all of his time to the service in order to bring jobs to his peers amidst the pandemic.\n\nThough he spends so much time working on personal projects, Naman knows the benefits of working as a team. Hackathons have instilled the value of teamwork in the workplace in him, making these events the perfect training grounds for the workplace. He\u2019s been able to bring this experience to the workplace through internships with great companies like Reddit and Opendoor. It\u2019s important to Naman to give back to the community. Seeing how passionate his fellow hackers are only makes him want to help them more, and have fun while doing so. They\u2019ve all helped him so much that it feels wrong to not reciprocate in ways that work for him. This is why he dedicates his time to MassApply, a service that he knows will have staying power outside of the pandemic, when tech jobs rear their heads more frequently once again. For the rest of his life, Naman wants to bring his unique style of helping to all communities, no matter the situation.",

    "about": "Jarrel was a tinkerer and enjoyed taking things apart when he was growing up. In middle school, Jarrel\u2019s best friend was interested in radio technology, and when they hung out, his friend would talk about tearing apart the technology he found on the street. Jarrel found himself getting interested as well,\u00a0 and they would spend their afternoons taking apart radios and boomboxes. Near the end of middle school, they expanded this interest into exploring other hardware and software, taking apart old PlayStations and Xboxes, digging into the hardware and firmware to figure out how it worked, and getting very mad when they accidentally broke stuff. Jarrel\u2019s biological dad was a car mechanic and good with electronics, so Jarrel continued these interests later in life by gaining some experience building custom speaker systems and working on cars.\n\nJarrel is mostly self-taught in his tech interests, and while his middle school did not have computer science classes, he took classes in game design to scratch his tech itch and joined the aviation club because it involved programming controllers and microchips on RC planes. In high school, he took computer business and computer system classes, but they were more oriented around business than tech, so he used YouTube to learn about coding and different forms of coding. When his mom saw him taking interest in technology in high school, she suggested that he try to be a mechanic like his biological dad because it made good money. Much of Jarrel's family were lower-class blue-collar workers, so they only knew how tech applied to mechanics, not about the world of opportunity for Jarrel\u2019s talents in computers. Jarrel ended up deciding to give mechanics a shot by attending a technical school.\n\nJarrel found Facebook groups and local groups for him to ask questions and gain resources from fellow developers. The local meet-up community skyrocketed him full force towards coding during his freshman year at technical school, as someone on Facebook told him about a nearby coding group, Riverside Hackerspace IO. The group worked on a variety of coding projects, introducing and tackling new ideas each month. They would decide on the project, meet over lunch or dinner to discuss and work together, and then collaboratively finish the rest of the project on GitHub over the following month.\n\nA member of the coding group offhandedly mentioned MLH and an event at UCR called Local Hack Day to Jarrel, and not knowing anything about MLH, he decided to google it. He found MLH really cool and watching YouTube videos about their work at various schools inspired him to attend Local Hack Day. The event wasn\u2019t as big as in the videos he saw, but being introduced to the work that MLH does and the hackathon environment got him hooked, and he could never get enough of hackathons since. He did not make a project at the event but was so amazed by the larger community that he spent the weekend attending workshops and soaking the experience in. He describes MLH as a gem that he is grateful for finding early on, and now when he sees anyone remotely interested in computers, he sends them towards MLH. Jarrel went on to attend Citrus Hack at UTR before branching out to other local in-person hackathons. He even traveled from California to Florida for an event and attended a number of virtual hackathons in 2020.\n\nBy the time he graduated from technical school, Jarrel realized that he had a good grasp of technical concepts but wasn\u2019t as good at applying them to mechanical work. He soon got a job at a local shop, and while a mentor trained him to refine his mechanical work, Jarrel helped the mentor with his computer, as he was attending hackathons at this time and developing computer skills as a hobby. The boss of the shop eventually asked Jarrel why he was working in the shop if he was already so good with computers, and a light bulb went off in his head.\n\nAfter talking to his then-girlfriend (now wife) about pursuing computer science, and consulting the Riverside Hackerspace for information, Jarrel realized that there are a ton of jobs for the things he was already doing on computers. Jarrel had never thought that his hobby could become his job, yet he forged a path to make that dream a reality. The hacker community helped Jarrel realize that he had the skills and potential to work with people that he had looked up to and that a career in computer technology was much closer than he had ever imagined. He attended Florida Tech to study Computer Science, graduated in February 2020, and secured a job in system administration afterwards. Jarrel worked in Windows and made custom bash scripts to configure the city of Redland\u2019s computer systems, as well as provided general IT technician support as needed. At the time, he was doing more business work than tech work but hoped to move towards web management and using HTML and CSS in the future.\n\nDespite being technologically savvy and fascinated by computers, Jarrel perceived the barrier for entry into the tech field to be higher than it actually was. It was only once he joined the hacker community that he realized how many applicable skills he already had and how attainable a career in computing would be. Hackathons helped Jarrel not only acquire professional skills, but also explore different fields of technology to find what he is passionate and proficient in, and just how they helped him explore and narrow down his career path choices, others too can forge their own way by exploring and learning at hackathons. Jarrel now works for Twilio as a support engineer and continues to encourage new hackers and the uninitiated to get into tech and begin their journey tackling causes they wish to help support or create solutions for. By showing them where to start and feeding their tech passion through solving an important issue, Jarrel helps many hackers become less intimidated by misperceptions about barriers of entry in the tech field, and helps them get their feet wet in the hacker community and start programming.\n\nOne of Jarrel's favorite projects he created was at the virtual event Hack20, not only because of the project itself but also because of his first experience in a team environment. Jarrel typically worked solo or with one other partner at hackathons, but for Hack20 he threw out a line on discord to see if anyone wanted to make a team. Other students from Virginia Tech started messaging him, and he ended up on a five-person team. They began by creating a project aimed at helping community members contact the police, but during a time of controversy and tension around police interactions with minorities, they felt that the project didn\u2019t make much sense. They decided to pivot and instead make a tool for police departments to try and improve such fraught relations. The project turned into POBS, a Police Officer Bias Simulator, which uses augmented reality to create a scenario simulator for training. Police would use the app on their phone and find themselves in a real-time geographically-simulated scenario where they must use their instincts to respond to the situation, and afterward receive a debrief with the impacts of their decision and action on the involved parties. The project ended up winning the Chef software prize, and Jarrel found the team dynamic exhilarating and a great learning experience that makes him want to work more with larger groups in the future.\n\nJarrel sees himself as an underdog in the hacker community who will never give up, coming from an underprivileged background to pursue his natural talents and passions in a field where he is an underrepresented minority. He may never be the next Linus Torvald or Bill Gates, but he will always be the one that stays up late at night learning as much as possible so that he can stay in the same room as the greats.",

    "about": "Mantas managed to find and hone his passion for programming through a tumultuous childhood, and upon discovering hackathons, he quickly found a supportive and welcoming environment that became a perfect community for him to practice and get excited about coding. Mantas first started studying computers at 11 years old, finding his love for ML/AI and game theory at the Vilnius Computer Academy in Lithuania. The many possibilities of these fields appealed to him and fueled his hunger to learn more. After some personal problems, he decided to move from home at 12 and attend V16 Gymnasium - the only Lithuanian school in Germany. Finding himself in a new country surrounded by a foreign language made him feel isolated and like an outcast, which led him to search for gaming and programming communities online. Communities such as HackerRank and CodinGame were welcoming to his curious and competitive nature, with young hackers to motivate him as well as older hackers to provide feedback and support. These communities were not only an escape from the unpredictable outside world, serving as a well-defined space of syntax and algorithms, but they also motivated him to keep learning and improving his coding abilities.\n\nThese communities helped him through two more school transfers over three years. Eventually, Mantas\u2019s German skills were good enough that he became ready to venture back into the outside world again. Searching for communities passionate about tech, teachers, and professors from the local university helped him enter as many competitive programming events as he could manage. In two years, Mantas won over 20 programming and algorithm competitions, including 1st place at RoboSchool and 1st place in the Saxony state algorithm competition. Mantas is also proud of a scientific paper he wrote in 12th grade on various ways of potentially solving the Beal\u2019s Conjecture, which won 1st place in Germany\u2019s region-wide project competition Jugend forscht (Youth Researching).\n\nJugend forscht was the first hackathon-esque event Mantas attended, but the first real hackathon he attended was HackaTUM 2018 after finding a poster advertising it in Munich. He applied without a second thought and went on to win a 1st place prize at the event with his team\u2019s project: Alexa Eye Doctor. The mobile app uses convolutional neural networks and other machine learning algorithms trained on facial image databases to detect and diagnose eye problems by examining the user\u2019s eyes, and the app can even send this data to the user\u2019s doctor. With home Amazon device integration the app supports a doctor visit scheduling tool, live consultations for urgent problems, displaying of a patient\u2019s medical history and previous diagnoses, and more! Since then Mantas has continuously scouted for and attended hackathons with every free weekend he has, traveling to various countries such as Germany, Lithuania, and Slovakia.\n\nMantas made certain to emphasize how important the hackathon environment and community are to him. From a childhood deprived of positive social interaction, Mantas learned how to channel his passions into competitive excitement at events like hackathons. He finds so much energy and joy from collaborating with others and loves reaching the tipping point where a million-dollar-idea clicks to create a unique solution. He is a driving force in generating an energetic atmosphere, with an aura of motivation, competitiveness, and positivity that boosts team morale and creates positive memories through successes and failures alike.\n\nFeeling so comfortable at these events has allowed Mantas to make many international friendships, and he loves the feeling of running into old teammates and friends at events. As cliche as he knows it sounds, he says that the most beautiful part of the hackathon journey is the forging of friendships along the way. This social aspect has had a strong positive impact on improving his life, especially as someone who moved over 10 times across various countries and struggled to find their community.\n\nMantas\u2019 favorite hackathon project was Reinvent the wheel! from TechFest 2019 in Munich, where his team was tasked with building a vehicle capable of turning its wheels 180 or even 360 degrees to best maneuver through an obstacle course. Mantas\u2019 contributions typically revolve around coding, and his projects tended to start around coding needs and then considering other necessary skills. For this project, however, programming was completed within a few hours, and most of the time needed to be spent on engineering and construction, so Mantas became an impromptu electrical engineer while his teammates constructed wooden and 3D-printed parts. He describes the process as a logistical catastrophe, and yet it reminded him why he loved hackathons\u2014tackling a unique task and figuring out how to surpass shortcomings with creative solutions and create functional prototypes. The project won 2nd place, but ultimately showed him that he would never get tired of the hackathon experience.\n\nMantas recently started his first IT-related job as a DevOp at BMW, and he is extremely grateful for not only the skills he learned at hackathons but for the great resume material he picked up along the way. Spontaneously learning new skills while working on hackathon projects is a valuable skill, and he even learned AWS and Azure services purely from their use at hackathons (both critical tools for his current job). Mantas notes that he sees his future self taking on higher positions where he will have to decide which technologies, frameworks, or libraries will be used for projects. Attending hackathons continues to expose Mantas to a wide array of tools and firsthand experiences that will be useful in his future career.",

    "about": "Mithra, like many in tech, didn\u2019t begin with dreams of coding as a career. At first, he was dead set on becoming a medical professional. He wanted to help people in order to find meaning in his work. But as he realized he wasn\u2019t truly passionate about health care, he made the last minute switch to Electrical Engineering. The path aligned with his interests, and still gave him the ability to make things that help people. But such a major switch in interest, after sticking to a specific study for so long, didn\u2019t come easily.\n\nMoving away from home to go to university was a massive life change that uprooted Mithra\u2019s support system. He didn\u2019t have the friends or family nearby to lean on when he realized that the EE degree he had switched to wasn\u2019t for him. His dreams of building were replaced with strict math, theory, and physics. Mithra fell into a funk, disheartened by his path, and fell out of the program. But he fought the funk, and landed an internship while steadily improving his grades and creating a new support system.\n\nThings were starting to look up, but Mithra still hadn\u2019t found his passion. Eventually, he found that passion at his first hackathon. During his time at a second internship, a friend invited him to join their hackathon team during the first summer of COVID-19. They had the express goal of building something to help with the pandemic. Mithra joined the team, learned about Figma design, and built the prototype that led to their team\u2019s win. From then on, he knew that he had a new passion in learning to code. It\u2019s just his first year as a hacker, but he knows that it won\u2019t be his last.\n\nAt a later hackathon, cuHacking, Mithra felt his support system grow even further when he met a fellow hacker than took him into their team with open arms. With the team, Mithra worked to build a website used to collect data from multiple devices in sync in order to give scientific labs a better integration system and data collection method. Mithra\u2019s eyes were opened to the potential of pi thanks to the team\u2019s use of raspberry pi and the mentorship of his new friend. The team extended the project to two different labs in Ottawa that had plans to utilize the site. Seeing the immediate real world implications of his own work was the greatest reward.\n\nMithra had a unique experience when it came to discovering what he wanted to do. It took fully immersing himself in a program, such as the robotics club or the electrical engineering courses, to realize when a path was not for him. Repeat misfires led to him feeling lonely, depressed, and unmotivated. MLH hackathons are what gave him the drive to work as hard as he could to pull himself out of the rut he was in. With a new lease on life, new passion, and new motivation, he had the curiosity to learn and build that makes every day important. His full-time work as an engineer and student is challenging, but he\u2019s more than content. By the time graduation comes along, Mithra will have participated in at least ten hackathons. He can\u2019t wait to continue to participate to the best of his abilities and even mentor soon enough.\n\nA believer in the power of pressure, Mithra thrives in hackathon environments. The personal and educational change that he has enacted in himself has come from high pressure situations that force him to learn something new. Beyond learning different technologies, he has also been given the opportunity to learn the variety of types of people. By working with teams of strangers, he was forced to break out of his comfort zone. It took practice at first, but it comes with ease now. This collaboration and adaptability will follow him into his future career.\n\nA recent goal of Mithra\u2019s is to organize a hackathon. As a relatively new hacker, he hasn\u2019t had the opportunity yet, but he has big dreams. From the beginning, the excitement with which he spoke about hackathons to his friends has inspired others to join him, both in his team or in separate events altogether. Seeing this ability to get others interested who were never previously interested gave him the hope to put his networking skills to the test as an organizer. His love for hackathons and desire to pay it forward will continue to spread no matter what stage of life he is in.\n\nThe route Mithra has followed has not been without its bumps. He was spiraling in a search to find a purpose, but he didn\u2019t give up. Instead, he picked himself up, cleaned himself off, and found hacking. This new healthy obsession gave Mithra a passion. From now on, Mithra will never count himself out, and neither will his peers.",

    "about": "During Kunal\u2019s freshman year, he was very confused as to where he should start his programming journey. The exponential options of learning paths that came with the various skills associated with programming left him overwhelmed at first. But he took the multiple options presented to him as a sign to take advantage of his resources and propel himself into his programming career. He attended and participated in events, expanded his network, and grew both as a developer and human being. Now, he brings the same opportunities that were given to him to others as he uses his position to give back to the community.\n\nA part of the hacker community starting at 15 years old, Kunal attended various inter-school programming competitions throughout his high school years. This participation sparked his love for the hacker community and the contributions he was able to make in order to support the community that gave him so much help during his beginnings. This emphasis on community is what has brought him so many experiences in the tech world in such a short amount of time, such as becoming an MLH Fellow, where he brought all of his past experiences to his team. During the Fellowship Hackathon of 2020, Kunal and his team created Bundly, a haven for the sake of finding all MLH Fellowship resources and information in one place. Designed specifically to enhance the Fellowship experience, Kunal was once again paying it forward to the group of peers that have given so much to him.\n\nOpen Source played a large part in Kunal\u2019s growth in the very beginning, helping him gain a lot of real world software development experience while building connections with others. His first experience with Open Source was a project by Red Hat. It at first seemed daunting, but the\u00a0 community was there to help him with his start. Ever since that experience Kunal has placed an emphasis on providing guidance and mentorship related to Open Source and various technologies to students from all around. This desire to teach has led him to YouTube, where he and his team have garnered\u00a0 60,000+ subscribers & community members across over 220 colleges that hope to learn together in the community. Beyond the mentorship experience of his channel, Kunal has conducted bootcamps and webinars across India, covering WebDev, ML, DevOps, Data Structures, and Open Source. After being invited to speak at an event called Kotlin/Everywhere, Kunal was given the chance to speak to over 300 attendees. He spoke about how to get started with Open Source and DevOps specifically. Kunal was flooded with support from students and teachers that saw the presentation. The satisfaction of knowing that his actions motivated others to contribute to the hacker space is an experience that he doesn\u2019t ever want to miss out on.\n\nWith this adherence to giving back comes Kunal\u2019s emphasis on promoting diversity in the workplace. He emphasizes the importance of participation from people of differing cultures in order to achieve instrumental growth of the IT sector. By being exposed to the multitude of values and principles that those of varying ethnicities hold, teams can appraise their work and the works of others in entirely new ways. This teaches a learned respect of opposing perspectives which creates a conducive workplace, as Kunal emphasizes in his workshops and hackathons that he participates in. Especially for those that are new to the hackathon space, Kunal knows that by making everyone feel welcomed, individuals naturally learn to accept and be grateful for the diversity of the space surrounding them.\n\nWith a litany of projects under his belt, Kunal is well-versed in the world of competitive hacking. But it\u2019s the lack of competition, the internships and workshops that promote cohesive team-oriented thought, that Kunal loves. As a Junior Team Lead for the MLH Fellowship Fall, Spring & Summer batches, he was given the opportunity to make even more of these contributions. Even with so much experience, Kunal is happy to say that he\u2019s just getting started, ready to spread the message of inclusivity to all that share the same positive energy as himself at future events.",

    "about": "Belonging was something Cecilia had long been looking for by the time she found the hacker community. She was questioning her decision to study software engineering as she felt like she didn\u2019t belong, and so when her friends dragged her to HackArizona 2016, she was terrified that she wouldn't fit in there either. Nagging thoughts dominated her mind on the drive there, but all she remembers from the event was how many fascinating people she met who were all excited about their ideas, the difficulties they would face, and trying new things. Cecilia was amazed at how they could be so enthusiastic about failure, because failure is not a bad thing at hackathons\u2014it\u2019s a learning experience. That experience made her rethink her approach to school: Cecilia hates failing but loves learning, and hackathons showed that she could reinterpret failure as a necessary part of the otherwise awesome process of learning.\n\nThe project she built with the team that dragged her there was ambitious, and it was the first time she learned something amazing that she would never find in a classroom. Cardboard Calamity was a chaotic team-building exercise inspired by terrible Freshman year icebreakers. Two people using Google Cardboard would see each others\u2019 perspective, and in front of them, one would have a diagram of an abstract lego construction while the other has a disassembled set of legos. The goal of the exercise is for them to communicate what they are seeing so that the user with legos can recreate the diagram with color-coded brick accuracy. Cecilia knew nothing about working with Android, Google Cardboard, or video streams, and the team also had to find legos. It was an intense project for a first hackathon, and they eventually got stuck at not being able to cross the streams, but she was at least really happy with the logo they made for the project and enjoyed playing with legos to relieve stress while problem-solving.\n\nAfter HackArizona 2016, Cecilia attended more hackathons and kept finding the same wholesome vibes that allowed her to thrive. She didn\u2019t care about winning prizes because she felt she was winning every time she learned something new that wasn\u2019t covered in school. Her mindset changed from \u201chow can I not fail my degree\u201d to \u201chow much more can I learn before I decide what to specialize in\u201d and \u201chow many incredible stories can I hear from a diverse array of hackers.\u201d She enjoyed meeting people at events who, like herself, had struggled to find a place in CS/engineering where they belong and can have a healthy mental state; hackathons supported them in the ways they needed: a sense of community, opportunities to learn new frameworks and languages, and a place to be themselves.\n\nCecilia wanted to do for others what HackArizona had done for her, so she soon joined the sunhacks team and fell head over heels into a whirlwind of organizing. After a year, she became their Director of Hacker Experience and made it her mission to cater to people who had never heard of hackathons. Based on conversations with attendees, Cecilia created intro workshops on how to build your own hackathon experience. Seeing hackers get excited about learning new things rather than stressing about what they don\u2019t know is always Cecilia's favorite part of hackathon organization, and helping to create such an environment at sunhacks has been extremely rewarding for her.\n\nNot only did hackathons make Cecilia change her mind about quitting university, but they also got her to finish her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees, and inspired her current pursuit of a Ph.D. in hackathons. Interested by the possibility of conducting research in undergrad, and in an attempt to get the school to pay for her hackathon expenses (which didn't work), Cecilia became curious about how attendees actually learn at hackathons\u2014many come in with no knowledge on a topic and leave 2 days later bursting at the seams with very specific knowledge. (She eventually answered this question in her first publication, examining how students can rapidly learn in hackathons; the answer is, essentially, everything a school classroom claims to but does not teach: pair-programming, talking through problem-solving, and working on problems step by step is how hackers learn from each other). Finding a love of research, Cecilia dove into other computing research topics through computer vision and machine learning projects at hackathons, which led her to a summer research position, conduct undergraduate research in a computer vision lab, and publish a paper. Upon realizing that not many people in academia were studying hackathons, Cecilia is now pursuing an engineering education Ph.D. to research hackathons. To answer all the questions she has, Cecilia\u2019s research will leverage hackathons to study deeper human phenomenons and explore the differences and similarities between hackathons and other learning settings to improve the learning and overall experiences of such events globally.\n\nCecilia has worked to integrate her discoveries back into hackathon organizing at sunhacks to make the environments more welcoming and supportive of diversity, so her first time attending Hackcon as sunhacks\u2019 newly appointed Director of Hacker Experience was terrifying but also immensely meaningful. There were organizers from women and non-binary events, international events, equal opportunity events, gigantic events, and small events. Cecilia met so many amazing organizers doing incredible things, and her nervousness quickly turned into an eagerness to learn whatever she could and apply it to sunhacks. Determined to return to Hackcon the following year with her own advice to share, Cecilia challenged herself to work on public speaking at sunhacks, as she is always trying to figure out how to make words stick in the minds of hackers. She used groan-inducing sun and plant puns not just to overcome her nervousness but to plant memorable seeds of information in attendees\u2019 minds. She also challenged herself to make a lightning talk for the following year\u2019s Hackcon, and it went perfectly as she told a bedtime story that called out organizers\u2019 bad habits, lulling listeners into turning a new page and encouraging them to break the cycle. Cecilia is happy to inspire organizers to tackle public speaking from different and more fun angles.\n\nThe public speaking experience Cecilia gains from guiding introductory and closing ceremonies hone invaluable skills for her future as a researcher, as she will be expected to present her work at conferences to share her findings, albeit in a less fun format than she does at hackathons. However, she knows there are differences between presenting her research at academic conventions and at Hackcon. Presenting to different audiences has helped her learn how to tailor presentations to an audience from content to terminology, but most importantly it has helped her appear confident even when shaking like a leaf. Hackathons have also helped Cecilia learn to communicate at different levels, as a hacker, programmer, organizer, or administrator, which helps her convey complex ideas to different people in the workplace and has made her a more adaptable and concise speaker.\n\nHaving been a new hacker once herself, Cecilia knows the importance of introductory presentations to ease new hackers into the community. That\u2019s why as an organizer she focuses on addressing the fear and discomfort that new hackers, people looking for a community, and those lacking self-confidence have when first attending a hackathon. Without a guiding hand, it can be hard to have a good first hackathon experience or even stay for the whole event, so Cecilia designed a presentation for sunhacks attendees that showed the structure of MLH hackathons while reminding them that the only expectations they should come in with are their own, as they have the power to shape their experience to get what they want out of it. Cecilia wants to challenge hackers to find what works for them in a space where everyone is welcome and worthy of support. Cecilia\u2019s efforts have led to constant positive feedback from attendees and established sunhacks as a beginner-friendly event where everyone can feel comfortable.\n\nWhile comfort is important to get new hackers in the door, Cecilia also believes a little discomfort is necessary to push hackers to become mentors at events. Hackers are often great resources, and anyone with a skill worth teaching, whether technical or abstract, can be a mentor. Cecilia makes sure to talk about how all sorts of skills are applicable at hackathons when discussing mentorship in her opening ceremony talks, and it always results in a number of last-minute signups. Creating a space that celebrates technical and abstract skills also helps create a welcoming environment for new coders and non-CS majors.\n\nEver since a group of hackers brought to her attention the need for accessibility accommodations a few years ago, Cecilia has been passionate about proactively looking for ways to make events more accessible whether attendees come forward about their needs or not. With the shift to digital events, she has made presentations accessible on sunhacks\u2019 website with alternative text and recently began experimenting with closed captioning support. Although there is more work to be done, it is the start of a process to make events more accessible and further Cecilia\u2019s goal of making sunhacks welcoming for everyone. To those ends, sunhacks has made great strides, as half of the speakers at their last event were non-white and half identified as women. The dearth of racial and gender diversity in STEM can start to be addressed by promoting visible representation of minority groups at hackathons, and Cecilia aims to make next year\u2019s event even more accessible by positively and visibly supporting LGBTQIA+ hackers and continuing to have diverse representation among their speakers and mentors.\n\nCecilia never imagined that she would be admirable or inspiring, but her work in the hacker community has spoken for her as many people have reached out to her and sunhacks asking for insights on their success and become fascinated by her research. Although not the most confident person, Cecilia is incredibly stubborn, diligent, and curious in her attempts to grow the hackathon audience, continually pursue change to prevent stagnation and complacency, and keep the community a place of opportunity and growth for those who fail to find inspiration in school curriculums. The hackathon community has pushed her out of her comfort zone to be an organizer, presenter, and researcher, and the work that she has done stands out as successful and valuable efforts to help people find hackathons as a place where they belong. She likes to think that she has helped carve out a home for hundreds of people to grow beyond what they thought was ever possible, and she hopes that conducting and applying her research in the future will let her build a home for thousands.",

    "about": "Like many students in his high school, Mudasiru believed that smart students should study medicine. With this goal in mind, he studied for his entry level exams, but the field was incredibly competitive and he failed the test three times. He was left questioning whether medicine was the industry for him.\n\nBefore he had time to get down on himself, his teacher introduced him to his first tech event. Thanks to the supportive words of the organizers, Mudasiru now saw that there was a career path that better suited him, and that path was coding.\n\nOnce he discovered his passion for coding, Mudasiru dove in head first. If there was a computing event nearby, Mudasiru would be there. When he wasn\u2019t at events, he was teaching himself with the resources he had. His goal to become a doctor was fueled by the desire to find solutions to problems and become a valuable asset to his community. Seeing now that he could repackage those desires into a totally different path that supported the same goals, he was drawn to tech.\n\nAfter being admitted to his university, he opted to run for a leadership position in a new Developer Student Clubs (DSC) chapter. When the position was given to an older student, he quickly became an active and supportive community member, attending events, workshops, and hackathons. Seeing all the work that he was putting into the club, other members encouraged him to organize an MLH event. Mudasiru was glad to accept, and soon MLH Local Hack Day 2019 was up and running at Mudasiru\u2019s university. Without a doubt, he was now a large part of the local community, giving back in the way he intended.\n\nJust a year later, after seeing how much work he put into the club, his peers chose him to lead the DSC. Keeping the same goals in mind, he made sure his community had access to tons of resources, ranging from AWS to Google products, in order to learn and explore easily together. This leadership experience brought him to GitHub, where he was chosen as a campus expert, and used community feedback to guide the way he leads by bringing tailored events and workshops to his equally eager peers.\n\nNo longer just an attendee of hackathons, Mudasiru and his team sought to give back at the Sustainable Development Goal Challenge event by building an app designed to tackle goal number one in his country: zero hunger. The function of the app allowed farmers easy access to produce orders and the general produce market. Now, still a student, Mudasiru and his peers were bringing noticeable change to their immediate community. He hopes to bring his knowledge from events such as this to become a software engineer to continue to bring such change nearby and around the world.\n\nUnfortunately, a new hurdle presented itself in the way of his new passion \u2014 COVID. All of the resources and technology once available to him were now suddenly gone due to the pandemic, but Mudasiru didn\u2019t let that get in the way of his journey. In an area without access to the tech needed, communities such as Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC), GitHub, Hack Club, Google Developers Group (GDG), and MLH are what gave him a platform to learn. With the onset of the pandemic, he was forced to teach himself virtually, where he found that these communities could provide said access, further accelerating his stance as a learner and a leader.\n\nHe started with goals of creating android apps, but his system didn\u2019t allow it. During his time spent inside, he didn\u2019t let his dreams of bringing change grow stagnant, instead learning many new frameworks and languages that would be added to his rolodex of information. He also used his knowledge to earn certificates in IT Support from Google, CompTIA, and others. The virtual MLH Localhost workshops that he attended, however, allowed him to leverage these new frameworks so that he was no longer at a disadvantage with resources. Mudasiru isn\u2019t one to give up, as shown by his journey with DSC, first denied a leadership position, then accepted as the head. He\u2019s thankful for his teacher, who saw that he wouldn\u2019t give up on medical school, and introduced him to a new path that he could put just as much energy into.",
