    "about": "Aniyah Norman has always loved technology. Through hacking and event organizing, she has made technology a central part of her life and benefited a wider hacker community.\n\nWhen Aniyah was a child, her family shared one desktop computer, which she used to play online video games. But as she got older, she expanded her tech knowledge and spent much more time building her skills. She says, \u201cSince the 6th grade, I have pretty much carried a laptop with me every day.\u201d However, her high school had very few coding resources, so she took the initiative to teach herself Python.\n\nAlthough she had a talent for coding and loved CS, she wondered if she was skilled enough to major in it. She started in Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Georgia, but quickly took a leap of faith and switched her major to Computer Science. It was the right decision. She says, \u201cBecause of tech, I've received once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, gained lifelong friends, and been a part of organizations that have influenced who I am.\u201d\n\nAniyah and her friends wanted more than the projects they had access to in class. She learned about UGAHacks 6 in the spring of 2021, formed a team, and fully committed to the hackathon experience. She gained so much through the event that she never looked back. She saw how web development, front-end coding, and the software development process work. She says, \u201cI was inspired by UGAHacks to learn more about computer science, and I knew I wanted to be a part of allowing the Computer Science community to feel the same passion I felt!\u201d\n\nShe jumped into hackathons as an organizer. She joined the university\u2019s next hackathon, UGAHacks 7, as the Logistics Director. She got to plan every stage of the event, feeling the stresses\u2014and rewards\u2014of putting together a major community event, the first in-person hackathon at the university since the start of the pandemic. The hackathon was a complicated venture, but she and her team pulled it off. Aniyah learned a great deal about her skills and leadership, finding her place in the hacker community. She sees UGAHacks as a way to help beginner coders grow and to challenge more experienced ones. Providing resources and opportunities for hackers to expand their knowledge drives Aniyah, and she thrives in her role.\n\nSince joining UGAHacks, she has expanded into other leadership roles to guide and mentor fellow hackers. She also joined ACM-W Girls.Code() and today serves as its president. She loves the supportive community both organizations provide. Aniyah is a woman of color and a first-generation college student, and she is proud to be a voice for underrepresented hackers. She says, \u201cAs a Black woman in technology, I have not always been confident in my own abilities because I almost fed into stereotypes and biases, but I had an amazing support system within the community that encouraged me to always know my worth.\u201d She has made connections that continue to strengthen and support her.\n\nAniyah\u2019s next venture is serving as lead director of the upcoming UGAHacks 8. Her involvement and engagement have helped her reach this level of leadership, and she is ready to take on new responsibilities. She says, \u201cI couldn't be more excited to continue supporting the hacker community!\u201d",

    "about": "Longtime Major League Hacking community members will recognize Stefan Aleksic. He took home MLH\u2019s Rookie of the Year in 2014 for his accomplishments creating the Cosmos Browser with fellow hackers Rohith Varanasi and Justice Suh. The revolutionary browser was the first of its kind to offer consumers the ability to browse the web without mobile data service, providing massive benefits in areas without widespread mobile broadband.\n\nStefan first discovered programming in junior high, and, like many, his passion stemmed from gaming. While playing Age of Empires 2, Stefan discovered the game\u2019s scripting language and unpacked it for himself, creating his own AIs within the game engine. He continued to develop his own games, and when he completed his first game, The Lost Mouse, Stefan says he realized he was \u201ccompletely obsessed with programming\u201d and had found his life\u2019s passion.\n\nFollowing his passion with a fervent dedication and a thirst for knowledge, Stefan continued coding into high school, developing Android apps to help students calculate molar mass or prank each other with photos of Nicolas Cage. But finding a dedicated community of hackers wasn\u2019t easy, and Stefan attributes being introduced to CodeDay Chicago by u/zachlatta, the Executive Director of Hack Club, as one of his life\u2019s \u201cpivotal moments.\u201d Asked how hackathons and the hacker community have changed his life, Stefan attested that they have provided him with \u201can overwhelming amount of agency.\u201d He even has a specific routine for how he spends the last night of hackathons, he says, going around \u201cintroducing himself and asking people what they worked on.\u201d It\u2019s in those moments, exhausted from a long day\u2019s work in the dead of night at 5 a.m., that Stefan has met some of his closest, lifelong friends.\n\nStefan has made his mark on the tech industry in the last few years since winning MLH\u2019s Rookie of the Year, working at top companies including Twilio, Uber, and Facebook. Since graduating, Stefan has founded his own company, Plasmo, that makes it easy for developers to make browser extensions, a passion of his from his hacking days. Stefan prides himself on taking initiative, and he says one of his favorite things about hackathons is that they \u201care all about building. They\u2019re not about pitching, ideating, or dreaming. You actually build that idea you dreamed of.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Stefan sees tremendous value in hackathons, which have helped him grow both personally and professionally, and provided him a community and resources with which to launch a successful career. Stefan has contributed wholeheartedly back to this community, helping to provide opportunities for others to find a passion in hacking as well. While making hackathons possible is nothing new for Stefan, who in 2014 helped found BrickHack at the Rochester Institute of Technology, he is looking forward to helping more hackers begin their journey in the fall. He plans to sponsor upcoming hackathons with his rapidly growing company, Plasmo, and aims to inspire the next generation of hackers the way he was inspired through hackathons earlier on in his career.",

    "about": "Michelle Yeojin Kim says her oldest passion is bringing her imagination into reality. In kindergarten, she liked to draw; in elementary school, she liked to freestyle her own LEGO creations; in high school, she liked to play music. Today she is an experienced hackathon organizer pursuing a career in game development.\n\nFirst finding her way to coding in high school, Michelle attended a weekly game development club, collaborating with other students to design a simple RPG. Motivated by that first experience with coding, she signed up for multiple computer science courses her freshman year at the University of British Columbia.\n\nWhen she was convinced by her friends to participate in nwHacks 2019, Michelle was initially nervous, and decided to volunteer at nwHacks that first year rather than participate. While there, Michelle felt inspired seeing more than 800 hackers all learning, building, and connecting. From that experience, one of her goals within the hacker community has been to \u201ccultivate a healthy hackathon culture.\u201d She joined nwPlus shortly after, wanting to make an impact on some of the largest hackathons in northwestern Canada. In addition to memorable experiences she wants to share with others, the hacker community to Michelle has meant \u201cever-lasting friendships, leadership skills, and organizing and public speaking skills.\u201d Having initially been nervous herself to attend nwHacks, she saw an opportunity to help others overcome their fears of attending hackathons.\n\nWith nwPlus, she has served as logistics coordinator, logistics director, and co-president. She organized both nwHacks 2021 and 2022, supporting more than 2,500 hackers worldwide to \u201cunleash their imagination and potential.\u201d Michelle, with her team, attempted multiple initiatives that would enhance hacker, sponsor, and mentor engagement in online hackathons. These initiatives included a new format for sponsor Q&As and booths, a hacker information package, and increased mentor awards and mentor-specific events.\n\nBetween the 2021 and 2022 hackathons, Michelle\u2019s favorite memory with the organization has been nwHacks 2022, where she says she \u201cadored\u2026hearing from the hackers and mentors who came back from last year\u2019s hackathon.\u201d Several hackers had become best friends and were hacking on the same team this second time around. Others had hacked with friends the year before but had decided to step out of their comfort zones and hack with strangers at the 2022 event. She continues to serve as co-president of nwPlus while working as a front-end developer at Later.\n\nWhile Michelle is better known for her contributions to the hacker community as a hackathon organizer, she has participated in hackathons as a hacker as well. Seeking to understand what a \u201cgood hackathon experience\u201d would feel like from the other side, Michelle began competing as a hacker after volunteering at nwHacks 2019 and cmd-f 2019. Entering senior year of her computer science undergraduate program and excelling academically, Michelle continues to give back to the hacker community as both a hacker and an organizer.",

    "about": "While she is now a seasoned product designer, Galaxia Wu says \u201cas a kid, I wanted to be a computer programmer before I even knew what it meant. I loved video games and spent every waking minute on the family computer.\u201d However, while in high school, she \u201cswitched gears and decided [her] calling was in fine arts.\u201d Dedicating her high school years to working towards an illustration program, she saw herself going into a career of animating movies for Pixar or illustrating books. While it was disappointing when the program she had worked so hard for rejected her application, she says she is now thankful for the rejection because it led her to apply for an Interaction Design program that completely changed her career trajectory. Now, three years later, she says \u201cI\u2019ve managed to mix my passion for art and computers to find myself a career in product design.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an impressive career at that, already including internships at Intuit and Meta. And while product designers aren\u2019t the largest major at hackathons, Galaxia says \u201cthe hacker community has changed my life in so many ways: it\u2019s shaped both my professional career and personal life in more ways than I can articulate.\u201d Despite describing herself as simply a designer who doesn\u2019t know how to code, Galaxia has built herself an impressive resume at hackathons. She\u2019s competed at several, such as DeltaHacks,SheHacks, and Hack the North, and, to top it off, she\u2019s helped organize four hackathons herself, including Sheridan College\u2019s, her own institution, flagship hackathon, Hackville.\n\nNow an MLH Coach, Galaxia didn\u2019t know much about hackathons in the months leading up to college. The first time she heard the word from a friend, she had mixed emotions, adding that, at the time, hacking to her \u201cevoked images of something you might see in Mr. Robot: guys in black hoodies in a grungy basement doing illegal stuff.\u201d However, after doing some research and finding out her school had a club that organized the college\u2019s hackathon, she decided to reach out to join. After all, it was \u201cnew, relatively small, and definitely didn\u2019t look illegal.\u201d When she competed at her first hackathon, she was welcomed in by two software engineering students. Not only did they teach her the basics of hackathons, but Galaxia says \u201ctheir support made the hackathon incredibly memorable for me, and I remember feeling so empowered and like I belonged.\u201d\n\nAs someone with an arts background, Galaxia understands what it\u2019s like to attend a hackathon as an outsider. However, she has used her own experience to give back to the hacker community significantly: her college has a high population of underrepresented students, so Galaxia has gone out of her way to make the hacker community more inclusive. Helping to run the Hackademics club at her college as well as organizing Hackville, she has given voices on her organizing team to international students and older students and has even held panels and events to give students the confidence to attend hackathons. In her new role as an MLH Coach, she hopes to have an even bigger impact on the community in the future.",

    "about": "Omar Ali, from Cairo, Egypt, did not get into programming until sophomore year of his electrical engineering program at Ain Shams University, but he has quickly made a name for himself within the hacker community. In the last year, he has completed the MLH Fellowship, contributed to several open-source projects, and has since gone on to work as an Admissions Specialist with Major League Hacking (MLH), helping to both interview and select the best candidates for the MLH Fellowship from the thousands of applications the program receives. Dedicating his free time to researching programming and computer-science-related subjects, as well as completing multiple online certifications, by his junior year, Omar had decided programming was his calling.\n\nOmar discovered programming later in his academic career, and in his first programming course where he learned C++, he says \u201cimmediately fell in love with the idea that I can create something meaningful by just typing on my keyboard.\u201d Continuing to develop his skills in C++, as well as learning front-end web development and Python, the ability to creatively solve problems using technology is something that appealed to Omar as both an electrical engineer and a programmer. Unsurprisingly, the hacker community seemed a perfect fit for someone as dedicated to programming as Omar.\n\nHe is active in a number of communities, participating in the Ain Shams University\u2019s Energy Sustainability Team and STP, for instance, as well as being active in the hacker community. Stumbling upon the MLH community while browsing a Facebook group for computer science and engineering enthusiasts, Omar was immediately hooked. Through the MLH Fellowship, he has been able to grow as a programmer enough that he is planning on pursuing a career in computer science instead of the path he had initially been set on of electrical engineering. Omar says, \u201cthe Fellowship and the hacker community provided me with a platform full of guidance, mentorship, and companionship.\u201d His experience in the fellowship allowed him to collaborate with fellow hackers from Brazil, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Italy, the UK, and Moldova, and Omar says he still keeps in touch with all of them.\n\nHis experience in the hacker community has prepared him well for his post-college career. \u201cThe fellowship didn\u2019t just turn me into a better engineer, but into a better human being as well.\u201d As one of the first Egyptians to join the MLH community, Omar has inspired other Egyptian students to pursue a career in tech and join the MLH community; Omar\u2019s own little brother, Mahmoud, was inspired to apply for the MLH Fellowship, and has actually become a Pod Leader, helping students as they complete their own Fellowships! Omar is proud to say that he has helped \u201cother aspiring students to join the hacker community and to have the once-in-a-lifetime experience\u201d that he\u2019s had. In addition to his time in the MLH Fellowship, he has secured his first full-time position as a back-end engineer. Omar looks to stay involved in the hacker community after graduating college, continuing to help newer hackers find their way.",

However, he took off in his own direction once he discovered technology, MLH, and the hacker community. This decision altered the trajectory of his life, converting him from a shy and reserved introvert to a public-speaking aficionado and coding expert.\n\nHe started coding very young\u2014in sixth grade, learning HTML, CSS, and C#\u2014 eventually finding his niche in web technologies. His first inspiration to code came from movies where someone in a hoodie hacks into networks. He remembers that it looked \u201ccool\u201d to have the intelligence and technical know-how to outsmart a computer, and he hoped coding would allow him to \u201cuse [his] skills to solve problems.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, he moved to a new city to start university. He found his calling there, primarily through tech meetups like Developer Circles Islamabad, his first of many. Just one year later, he went from a shy attendee to a speaker at Facebook Hackathon. This transformation was a direct result of the various hackathons he attended and organized, where he gained confidence in his skills and became a crucial part of many networks and communities.\n\nArsalan has cast a wide net very quickly. His public speaking and technical expertise have led to him live-streaming with GitHub Education, Dev.to, and Microsoft. His mentorship roles in various organizations (including Major League Hacking) have helped less experienced hackers find their own success. He brings younger students at his university into the hacker community, giving them hands-on positions in communities he founded, such as Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) NUML. He also supports new members of Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors (MLSA) Islamabad, helping them extend their reach and scale as a chapter.\n\nSo far, the sky's the limit for Arsalan. His talent and instruction, particularly in community building, have led to him being the only GitHub Field Expert from Pakistan.\n\nHis journey and the world of MLH are tightly linked. His technological evolution through the hackathon community includes participating as a hacker, MLH Localhost organizer, MLH Fellow, and MLH Pod Leader. He has faced issues with self-confidence which drove him to give up halfway through applying to the MLH Fellowship for the first time. Yet, he didn\u2019t quit. A week later, after he saw a post about a partnership between MLH and Facebook, he finished the application and submitted it. When he was accepted, as he says, \u201cThat was a lesson for me not to underestimate myself.\u201d He credits tech and the hacker community for his tremendous evolution. He went from an 11-year old kid whose \u201clegs would begin to shake\u201d at the thought of interacting with large groups to someone whose \u201cconfidence and abilities have grown\u201d significantly.\n\nMLH is a major part of his life today more than ever. After graduating as a Fellow, he became a Pod Leader, helping grow students in the Fellowship, and excelled. He saw how well he worked with community members and knew he could have a future with the organization. In early 2022, he applied to work for MLH, and today he is a full-time employee.\n\nArsalan has flourished in technology, coding, and programming. He has grown in confidence, building his brand and speaking at large events, and is well on his way to guiding others in the MLH community to be their best.",

    "about": "Today Skyler Basco is an established hacker, but she had a difficult entry into computer science. Her first hackathon, TeenHacks LI, in the fall of 2019, was her first time writing code. She was using HTML and enjoyed learning it, but the frustration of her \u201chunt and peck\u201d style of typing drove her away from coding for two years. When she circled back to it in the summer before her first year of college, she had a burning desire to learn computer science. Hacking is all about problem-solving, and like a true hacker, Skyler figured out how to solve her problem\u2014she mastered touch typing and unlocked her potential.\n\nWith computer science now her major and her goals becoming clearer, she jumped back into hackathons wholeheartedly. In the fall of 2021, at the Youthopeian Hackathon, she saw the dynamic interactions and exciting projects that make hackathons so rewarding. Her partner specialized in backend design, while Skyler brought frontend and UX design talents, showcasing how much they could learn from each other.\n\nIn only her third hackathon, the QImpacts! Hackathon, she won first place. Her project Unicorn Stack brought in elements of financial literacy and game design to create a winning hack. This victory inspired her to learn as much as possible about computer science and to relay her knowledge to inspire other hackers. It was, she says, \u201ca huge shift in my personal life: a shift that inspired me to build, learn, and share with others.\u201d Today, she presents online workshops at hackathons worldwide, spreading her wealth of wisdom to countless coders.\n\nHer actions didn\u2019t go unnoticed. In January of 2022, she did her first software engineering internship at Bitly. In that role, she and other interns focused on making Bitly\u2019s API more user-friendly. The team worked from all sides to solve problems, with Skyler focused on the Bitly API request page. She said, \u201cA top highlight was sharing my UI Design knowledge with both my fellow interns and mentors.\u201d As part of the planning process, Skyler gave the team a crash course in Figma, allowing them to visualize their features and create prototypes. The way the team worked together amazed Skyler, and she realized that in technology, everyone has strengths that can fit into different projects.\n\nShe has reflected on the \u201cwhy\u201d of computer science, wondering about the motivations of people who code. Her reason is the inclusion of underrepresented hackers. Growing up in suburban New York, she saw an absence of opportunities for women of color to pursue STEM-related fields. After her Bitly internship, she saw the potential to help hackers like herself. As she says, \u201cThis life-changing experience helped me feel more connected to the perspectives of underrepresented students and other newcomers in tech. I wanted these individuals (who were just like me when I first started coding!) to feel welcomed to the tech industry, encouraged to build cool innovations, and mentor other aspiring technologists in the process.\u201d Mentoring has become her priority and she strives to help people of color, especially women, meet their goals in STEM and computer science.\n\nPart of this process is joining organizations and hackathons so she can meet and interact with various hackers. In addition to participating in MLH events, she is a part of Girls Who Code, Rewriting the Code, and Break Through Tech, all organizations that she says \u201cwelcomed me with open arms when I first pivoted into the tech industry.\u201d She also has a YouTubechannel to share her experiences as an SWE intern, create tech content, and \u201cfurther leverage technology as a tool for change.\u201d\n\nSkyler is full of energy (she can rap the fastest verse of Eminem\u2019s \u201cRap God\u201d at 110% speed) and dedication to the hacker community. Her skills, desire to share knowledge, and refusal to give up on herself and others make her one of the MLH Top 50.",

In that program, he developed a project in PHP,\u00a0 MySQL, and HTML. He was instantly hooked. Damir quickly set his sights on coming to the U.S. and majoring in computer science. \u201cMy love for the field has been growing ever since,\u201d he says.\n\nThis was easier said than done, however. Damir experienced a great deal of social pressure to stay on a career path that was predetermined for him by his elders. \u201cMy grandfather, who is my role model and a true mentor in life, wanted me to pursue finance. He saw me becoming a banker one day,\u201d he explains. Armed with courage, passion, and self-belief, Damir eventually made the move to Chicago and enrolled at the University of Illinois Springfield.\n\nOne cold and snowy Midwestern morning, Damir opened the MLH newsletter and saw an invitation to join a Local Hack Day. He wasn\u2019t quite sure what a hackathon really was or if he\u2019d enjoy it, but he was open to finding out more. He joined a Discord community to find a guild and some mentorship. \u201cJoining that guild was the best introduction to the MLH community I could ever wish for,\u201d he recalls, adding that the people were kind, helpful, and welcoming to beginners.\n\nThat first hackathon helped Damir realize that he was moving forward. \u201cComing to the U.S. was a big shock for me, and it took me a very long time to adapt to the college environment,\u201d he admits. However, he has no doubt that following his own interests have been to his benefit. \u201cIt is not a bad idea to go against the grain of a cultural mindset and do something that you want,\u201d he says.\n\nHaving fallen in love with hackathons, Damir decided to apply for the MLH Fellowship. Initially he was rejected from the full program but jumped on the chance to participate in the Fellowship\u2019s prep program when it began last summer. He feels like the experience\u2014particularly the daily standups\u2014was \u201cabsolutely amazing.\u201d He was accepted to the full MLH Fellowship shortly after. Since being accepted once, he\u2019s since been a part of three batches of the MLH Fellowship.\n\nNine hackathons in (and counting), Damir says that his favorites were the MLH Fellowship Orientation Hackathons. \u201cThey are a super cool way of onboarding fellows to what MLH is all about: having fun developing as one big community.\u201d Through the fellowship, he learned new technologies, met more people, and accepted more responsibilities. However, Damir admits that he kept returning to the fellowship because of the people. \u201cI did not want to leave an amazing community of which I grew fond of.\u201d\n\nAs a three-time MLH Fellowship Alumni, Damir began wondering what drove the machine from the inside and decided to join the ranks of those who made his experience so enjoyable. Now he serves as an admissions specialist and as a Pod Leader for the summer fellowship, working with two fellows who are contributing to open-source projects run by a cancer research hospital. He also contributes to the production engineering track hosted this summer in collaboration with Meta.",

From his days as a little boy in Vancouver playing with the colorful bricks to watching the LEGO movie every day after school to joining the First Lego League at his parent\u2019s request, this world-famous Danish toy brought this young Canadian to find his path.\n\nIn grade 7, Matthew started experimenting with LEGO Mindstorms to build and develop programmable robots. His passion for building and coding only grew during high school where he elected to enroll in classes like Introduction to Python and other entry-level coding courses. However, it was during his final year of high school that he joined the FIRST Tech Challenge and accepted a coding and development role on the team, cementing his desire to enter the tech industry.\n\nMatthew graduated from high school in the spring of 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and the beginning of the shutdowns. He took that time to develop his coding skills and experiment with machine-learning libraries and data science. By the fall, Matthew had joined the Simon Fraser University\u2019s Faculty of Computing Science. Despite the challenges of pandemic life and shutdowns, Matthew remained bright and hopeful.\n\nWhen his mom got in a car accident that September, however, Matthew pitched in to help at home. He pulled back on his course load, but he also started to fall behind in his studies. \u201cI was also losing my love for computer science, technology, and coding,\u201d he recalls.\n\nMatthew wanted to reignite his passion, so he took a data science bootcamp to solidify his understanding of data science and machine learning. His interest restored, he felt ready to pursue his studies once again. It wasn\u2019t long before his friends \u201cdragged\u201d him to Hack The Valley 5 because \u201cI wasn\u2019t as motivated to self-learn as I am now.\u201d\n\nThough nervous at first, Matthew soon found himself interacting with tons of hackers who embraced him. He discovered that he loved joining workshops, focusing on a project for an entire day or two, and meeting lots of people. \u201cI found the hacking community to be constructive, warm, and welcoming,\u201d he says.\n\nWith his goal of attending a hackathon every two weeks, not only was he learning, but he was quickly making lots of new friends through the hacker community. With that in mind, he created the Discord server he named \u201cHack Club\u201d. He intended it to be a place where he could include everyone he met through hackathons and for them to grow as a group. Now with 31 members, his discord is filled with supportive, caring people that are proficient in a variety of skills, including front end, back end, machine learning, design, devops, and presentation. Members can freely invite their friends or anyone who might be a good fit for the server.\n\nMatthew attributes his accomplishments to his supportive friends and hackathon events. Through hackathons, he has been able to network with industry professionals and like-minded individuals; mentor and build a small, supportive hacker community; and land his first job in a full-stack internship role at a local hospital. \u201cThat\u2019s something I never would have dreamed of a year ago,\u201d Matthew says. \u201cHackathons have changed my life in more ways than one.\u201d",

    "about": "Elizabeth Qiu is a senior in high school, but has already made an enormous impact and developed a significant skillset. Whether it is kickstarting events, spearheading technology projects, or collaborating with business and political leaders, she is perpetually engaged with her community.\n\nShe was first introduced to computer science in 9th grade, though her goal then was to be a concert pianist. However, she became more and more interested in tech, even canceling a weekend piano competition to attend a Women in Technology event to learn more about the STEM field. A friend told her about hackathons, and she committed to participating in Technica 2019 that same year. A direct result of her experience at Technica was her enrollment in a technology program, keeping her motivated and hungry for more knowledge.\n\nSince her introduction to tech, she has served many roles at over twenty hackathons: attendee, mentor, speaker, consultant, volunteer, and organizer. She says, \u201cI wanted to emulate the sense of community and share opportunities with others, which prompted me to organize events of my own.\u201d She focused on expanding inclusivity, diversity, and beginner-friendly options in this role and secured significant funding and sponsorships from various organizations.\n\nOne reason for Elizabeth\u2019s success is her unwavering attitude and dedication. She is well aware of gender inequalities and even discrimination in tech circles. She turns that under-representation into fuel to create positive change. As she recalls, \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot by working with many diverse groups, but I\u2019ve also been used to working as the only girl on a team, from being the only girl on the dev team in an internship to being the only girl in a weightlifting class.\u201d Her response? She became the elected president of her school\u2019s STEM club, a heavily-involved member of Hack Club, and the only woman on the founding team of a hackathon, for which she later served as Executive Director, scaling it to become the largest high-school hackathon in her state with over 400 attendees. Her work has earned her many awards, and she is a recipient of the President\u2019s Gold Volunteer Service Award and an NCWIT Impact Winner.\n\nWhile her accomplishments are impressive, some of the most valuable work she does is for the hacker community. She brings inexperienced hackers unfamiliar with hackathons to each one she attends to make them feel as welcome as she did. She also enjoys providing 1:1 mentorship to new hackers and helps hackathon organizers run successful events. Other contributions include increasing marketing and outreach for CodeDay, collaborating with local and school-based organizations like Girls Who Code, and securing funding for scholarships for younger coders. She has also recently launched a 501(c)3 non-profit, makerspce, which distributes microgrants for STEM projects and education in underserved areas. She knows the impact that funding and computer science instruction can have, particularly on underserved populations and genders.\n\nElizabeth is full of charisma, compassion, and drive to make the world a better place. She will study Computer Science and Law in college, where she hopes to continue learning and building.\n\nHer most significant impact may be yet to come.",

    "about": "While Sarah Fluck only recently burst into the hacking scene, she is already a force to be reckoned with. Initially earning her degree in English and Philosophy from the University of Southampton, it is clear she has always had an inquisitive mind. Getting into hacking wasn\u2019t easy at first, especially while working a full-time job in general administration and with no formal educational background in coding. However, she says she \u201chas always been technically minded\u201d and always had a desire to understand the ins-and-outs of software development. So when the COVID-19 pandemic struck and Sarah found herself with significantly more time on her hands to dedicate to learning, she hit the ground running.\n\nFirst teaching herself HTML and CSS using online resources such as W3Schools and Sololearn, she quickly moved on to JavaScript. Sarah admits it \u201cfelt like quite a big jump, and initially I didn\u2019t think much of it as I found the syntax confusing and couldn\u2019t understand how it would be genuinely useful.\u201d But she persevered, dedicating countless hours to developing her skill set. To further improve her coding abilities, she signed up for an online computer science class, CS50: Introduction to Computer Science, offered through Harvard University. During this course, Sarah spent much of her time learning C, which gave her solid fundamentals with which to build projects in C++.\n\nAn expert at solo learning, Sarah soon discovered that one of the best ways to break into the programming community was \u201cto make contributions to open-source projects.\u201d Still new to the world of programming, Sarah wasn\u2019t sure where to begin, but she found a great start when she accidentally \u201cstumbled upon the MLH Fellowship from a random blog post which listed different ways to get into open-source\u201d. Though she had low hopes of making it to the interview stage, she was pleasantly surprised when she not only made it to the interview stage but was accepted into the program itself. Sarah says finding that not \u201ceveryone in my pod was a CS student, some had different majors and some were also self-taught like myself,\u201d reassured her that she had earned her place in the hacker community.\n\nAt her first hackathon, an orientation hackathon organized by MLH in the first week of her Fellowship, she and her team developed Owlhub, an app geared specifically for fellow coders to share their code. As part of the MLH Fellowship, she has contributed to Hermes, an open-source engine optimized for React Native, even further growing her skills in C++. Despite her self-described non-traditional background, Sarah has grown into her own in the hacker community. She has taken initiative at every opportunity, having informal Q&A sessions \u201cwith professional developers at major tech companies\u201d and even forming a \u201cstudy group with fellow students to practice leet code questions.\u201d She earned her first professional role in software engineering in London earlier this year. \u201cHad I not realized my passion for technology and to always be learning new things,\u201d she says, \u201cI might still be working in administration.\u201d",

    "about": "Uditi Sharma embodies the independence and creativity of many standouts in the hacker community. A high school student living in Dubai, she is one of the few female coders in her community and has forged her own path. Her mission to help women enter the world of coding continues to push her forward today, and she shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nShe started coding in 7th grade, creating apps with the help of free online tutorials. She has taught herself many skills and technologies; motivated by a love of creating things from scratch, leading to incredible results.\n\nWhile Uditi loves computer science, it hasn\u2019t all been smooth sailing. During her first hackathon, she saw how male-dominated the space could be. Though she had coding experience and knew her way around the technology, she felt pushed out. Not one to give up, Uditi found out about AIHacks, a hackathon for female and non-binary students. There, she realized the full power and potential of the hacker community. She says, \u201cSince then, I've been a part of many more gender-focused hackathons, and I've had an incredible time being part of such supportive and uplifting communities!\u201d\n\nThe tech community at her small Dubai high school is limited. Major League Hacking (MLH) member events and other hackathons provide a network of individuals who share her dreams and goals, and this support has inspired her to organize her own.\n\nOne significant contribution she has made to the hacker community is founding Elevate Tech, a nonprofit organization that empowers underrepresented genders in technology and entrepreneurship. Her organization offers coding bootcamps, workshops, mentorship programs, and its own hackathon \u2013 Elevate Hacks. This hackathon attracted more than 600 hackers from 35 different countries, all thanks to the efforts of Uditi and her organization. As the administrative lead, she handled all the logistics, outreach, and marketing for the event, and the reward was immediate. The participating hackers created apps that address pressing problems like climate change, educational inequality, and social injustice. For her, the most rewarding part has been witnessing the passionate young women at Elevate Hacks who were driven to change the world. She believes that every young girl has the power to change the world when given access to platforms that showcase their talents.\n\nAfter Elevate Hacks 1, her team has dedicated itself to long-term initiatives supporting Elevate Tech\u2019s vision of empowering people of marginalized genders in technology and entrepreneurship. These include a fellowship and mentorship programs geared towards introducing young developers to the intersection of technology and product development. Their team is also planning the second iteration of Elevate Hacks, scheduled for August 2022. Uditi\u2019s nonprofit work at Elevate Tech has been recognized by Apple and Harper Bazaar Arabia\u2019s joint campaign on women in technology and the Diana Award Foundation.\n\nIn certain parts of the world, tech is not embraced and taught as readily as in others. Uditi says, \u201cAlthough I love the multicultural and diverse experiences I've had growing up in the Middle East, I'm saddened by the lack of technology-focused events, especially those targeted toward high school students.\u201d She is doing her part to increase exposure to tech in Dubai for young adults through the hackathon she organized, Elevate Hacks, and strives to build more of the supportive community she feels is missing. Uditi has been involved with Girl Up\u2019s MENA regional leadership team, overseeing STEM initiatives in the region and advancing education and opportunities for young women in the Middle East. Uditi currently interns at the Game2Learn lab at North Carolina State University, supporting a research group studying the persistence of women in introductory Computer Science classes. She is in the process of publishing a children\u2019s book and hopes to inspire more young girls to break stereotypes and pursue STEM. She sees a future for herself in academia or the nonprofit industry.\n\nFor someone still in high school, Uditi has achieved major goals. Her selfless ambition to support young coders and women in tech makes her an inspiration to the hacker community.",

    "about": "Ashwin has nurtured a lifelong passion to learn how everything works. As a teenager, he realized the power of computers to transform imaginative ideas into reality. This realization turned into a love for computer science and technology. Ashwin spent his high school years winning interscholastic competitions in software technology, graphic animation, and editing, but it was only when he graduated from high school and attended Harvard\u2019s CS50 that he began gravitating towards coding.\n\nHe completed CS50 despite many hurdles and became acquainted with competitive programming. Over the next two years, Ashwin explored computer science, including web development, machine learning, DevOps, and cloud. But, as he says, \u201cit wasn\u2019t until I found communities that I could truly unlock my love for technology.\u201d\n\nDuring a pandemic lockdown in March 2021, Ashwin happened to be scrolling through LinkedIn when he saw a post about an MLH Local Hack Day, the event that later became MLH Global Hack Week. Seeing that every participant received free stickers, and having a dream to fill his laptop with stickers, Ashwin decided to join in. Even though he was completely new to Discord and Devpost, he created and submitted a very simple program. He realized that being a beginner shouldn\u2019t keep you from trying.\n\nAfter attending MLH events, Ashwin started getting to know the community and finding ways to be involved. He also found other communities, like BlahajGang, EddieHub, HackThisFall, and ElleHacks, that had similar goals. \u201cThe very welcoming community members made me instantly interested in getting involved to learn new tech with the community.\u201d Not only did Ashwin find a supportive community, but he also gained valuable career advice through resume reviews, public speaking sessions, and games. Ashwin says, \u201cin the end, I joined for the swags and stayed for the amazing community.\u201d\n\nHe credits the inclusive, beginner-friendly culture of the student-run communities for encouraging him to try new technologies, write tech blogs, host livestreams, and more. \u201cI made amazing friends across the globe who have been a constant support in and out of the community, constantly encouraging me to improve myself.\u201d\n\nAshwin found himself greatly inspired from his first month of attending hackathons. He soaked up as much as he could and listened to countless talks and podcasts. Ashwin also attended various public speaking sessions during this time and admits to making a lot of mistakes. However, he saw those mistakes as learning opportunities and didn\u2019t give up. In the year that followed, Ashwin participated in over 50 events, won 11 of them, and became a student leader. He says that it was through these events that he networked with others, discovered some of the best tech, and learned best practices for teamwork and delegation.\n\nHe was also able to gain acceptance to a variety of student programs that had rejected him the year before. \u201cInitially, I was rejected from every possible student leadership and community program, but that did not stop me from starting a community.\u201d In fact, Ashwin took the feedback from those rejections to help become a better community leader.\n\nAshwin realized that his own local community was missing guidance, resources, and opportunities, so he decided to be the change. He started a new, inclusive, beginner-friendly student-run developer community called Hack Club Hackerabad. \u201cHackerabad always approaches with a mindset larger than campus to provide free and quality resources and guidance to all students.\u201d The core team consists of eight SNIST students with three HackClub Leads representing different genders and ages at the helm. \u201cNot everyone knows how to code, but each member has the vision to upskill in the developer community,\u201d says Ashwin. This beginner-friendly, interest-driven community has more than 320 students worldwide joining its Discord server.\n\nAshwin is currently a third-year student studying Electronics and Computer Engineering at Sreenidhi Institute of Science & Technology: Hyderabad Campus. He has become the first Github Campus Expert in his state as well as a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador. Ashwin continues to help other students generate a passion for technology by hosting speaker series, joining podcasts and Twitch streams, and even organizing a high school hackathon with CodeDay.",

    "about": "Bailey Luu credits the MLH hacker community for her growth and evolution. It\u2019s safe to say the feeling is mutual. The number of hacks she participates in, the amount of leadership and mentoring she does, and her selfless dedication have led to her success.\n\nIn 2016, during her 10th-grade year, she found her passion for coding, by teaching herself. Learning HTML without taking a class is complicated, but she mastered it quickly and created her first HTML website on her own. The site combined her newfound curiosity about coding with her affection for movies, showing her the potential of computer science. She recalls, \u201cBeing able to apply what I learn and build what I love is a great feeling.\u201d\n\nSince then, Bailey has not slowed down at all. She devoted the next two years of high school to learning Arduino and Java, creating projects like a Morse Code Translator.\n\nBy the time she enrolled at York University, she was ready to jump into coding head first. She discovered Major League Hacking (MLH) through her first hackathon: ElleHacks, in the winter of 2020. At ElleHacks, she and her teammates developed GreenGrocery, an app that allows users to manage their food supplies, alerts them of upcoming expiration dates, and delivers customized recipes based on their foods. The app used Figma as its tech stack, giving Bailey another notch in her technology belt.\n\nOnce she had completed her first hackathon, the floodgates opened. Through the MLH newsletter, she learned about the upcoming Local Hack Day 2021, which she attended and where she met members of the guild BLAHAJGang, founded by Jacklyn Biggin and Adam Drummond, a global community connected by a shared love of technology and coding, and it was an instant source of knowledge and excitement for her and remains so today.\n\nAt LHD, she dove into artificial intelligence, data visualization, and frameworks like React. As she became more proficient in these technologies, her involvement in MLH grew stronger. Soon after, she joined yuHacks, PennApps XXII, Neighborhood Hacks, and Hack This Fall. As she attended more hackathons, she came to consider the technical knowledge she developed a prize of its own. The things she learned at hackathons weren\u2019t covered in school.\n\nIn the fall of 2021, Bailey\u2019s approach to hackathons shifted. She saw these hackathons\u2019 immense impact on her technological and social development, and she wanted to give back. She says, \u201cSince MLH provides me great joy in the hacker community, I love to spread the joy to other folks who haven\u2019t known about MLH or want to explore Computer Science.\u201d As an ambassador, volunteer, and eventually a hackathon organizer, she could provide that joy to newer hackers. Besides offering support and guidance to hackers of all experience levels, she saw the draw of the organizer community. She appreciates the communication between organizers, technical knowledge gained from running the event, and the tight-knit feeling of being on a team.\n\nAs an ambassador and hacker at Hack This Fall, she met ambitious and brilliant individuals who would guide her towards organizing and progressing in the MLH world. This ambition rubbed off as she jumped into subsequent roles as Logistics Executive at ElleHacks and Technical Lead at yuHacks/GDSC YorkU.\n\nBailey has shown nothing but an intense desire to help others enjoy the same experiences she had, and she continues to rise to the top of the MLH community. Throughout her journey, Bailey has been inspired by the ways other hackers use technology, and by the impact that technology can have on social change. Seeing their projects has motivated her to learn more. As she says, \u201cI couldn\u2019t [have] become who I am today without MLH, BLAHAJGang, friends, and family. Thank you, hacker community, for nurturing my passion.\u201d",

He has continued to grow as a programmer ever since, working part-time as a software engineer for start-up venture Data For Brands, all the while staying active in the hacker community. In February of 2021, Ali and his colleagues from the Tunisian Space Association won the KiboCUBE competition, organized by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs in coordination with the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, and will be launching their satellite directly from the ISS by 2024. And to top it all off, he\u2019s also completed the competitive 12-week MLH Fellowship.\n\nAli believes the impact of the hacker community has been instrumental in leading him down his career path. Through the hacker community, Ali says he has \u201cbeen exposed to success on a daily basis.\u201d During his 2021 Major League Hacking (MLH) Fellowship, Ali was able to work with talented hackers from all over the world. Touching on his experience in the MLH Fellowship, Ali states: \u201cIt was truly an eye-opening experience, as it taught me a lot about myself, technology, and how real-world projects are conceived and created from scratch.\u201d In fact, he enjoyed the MLH experience so much that he wanted to share the experience with other hackers, and subsequently joined MLH as an Admissions Specialist, helping to interview and select the best candidates for the MLH Fellowship from the thousands of applicants the program receives.\u201cI am extremely happy to see the impact that I\u2019m able to have on the fellowship\u201d and on future candidates, Ali says. He has since worked his way up to the role of Senior Admissions Specialist.\n\nAli is giving back to the hacker community in more ways than one. He has big ambitions, dreaming of one day becoming the Tunisian Minister of Technology, and leading a golden age of technology in Tunisia. He is already leading by example, contributing work to the Tunisian Space Association for the second-ever Tunisian satellite. He credits the \u201cresourceful and brilliant engineers\u201d he has worked with there as further inspiring him to make Tunisia the \u201cnumber one country in Africa in the space industry.\u201d He continues to be fully dedicated to his craft, working part time as a software engineer while founding his own company, 619 Street, which aims to connect fashion retailers across Tunisia. Ali also seeks to provide a platform for young Tunisian fashion designers to promote their work. 619 Street is slated to fully launch in the summer of 2022.\n\nHis hard work has continued to pay dividends. Recently, out of more than 10,000 applicants, Ali was selected as one of 36 recipients of the prestigious Thomas Jefferson Scholarship Program. He will be traveling to the United States for the 2022 to 2023 academic year to study software engineering. \u201cI am so proud to be a cultural ambassador for my country,\u201d Ali says, \u201cand I can\u2019t wait to live this experience and represent my country overseas!\u201d",

    "about": "Monique Reed has had a love for technology as long as she can remember, despite only recently getting into coding in the summer of 2020. Her first programming experiences came through a FreeCodeCamp certification she earned and a summer tech program she attended built to support marginalized students. Despite being 15 minutes late for the start of that program, she enjoyed every second afterward as she joyfully dove into writing code. Monique knew she had found a calling in technology, and after that summer program, she got involved with after-school coding programs and eventually found Major League Hacking through Global Hack Weeks.\n\nHer first ever hacker event, Global Hack Week: INIT in 2021, was a similarly thrilling experience to her first experiences with coding. Monique relished every second of the hackathon, appreciating the new skills she was learning, the practical experience that helped her grow her abilities, and the ability to learn and work as part of a team. Monique says she joined the hacker community through MLH. While she was initially skeptical that she could join a global community of hackers, through MLH and MLH\u2019s partner hackathons, she discovered what it was like to be part of a larger community of fellow enthusiasts for tech.\n\nMonique believes hackathons have changed her life. At Pearl Hacks 2022, Monique worked with a team to develop a self-care application that included interactive self-care tips, a \u201cletter-in-a-bottle\u201d online diary, and a recipe generator based on user grocery lists. The whole team pushed beyond their comfort zones to learn React with a Python API embedded. While Monique says the project turned out to be a \u201ccomplete flop\u201d due to a route error, she appreciated the experience of bonding with her team to identify a problem and innovate a solution together. In the months since competing in Pearl Hacks, Monique has watched countless YouTube videos on React projects and has dedicated her time to learning even more.\n\nMonique says, \u201cHackathons have really given me a chance to embrace my flops.\u201d Learning from failures is par for the course in coding, and Monique appreciates that aspect of hackathons. \u201cI struggle with fitting in most of the time and navigating impostor syndrome,\u201d Monique says, adding \u201ccoding is really messy, and I live for the mess because I have learned that the most beautiful things come from messes.\u201d Through her experiences with hackathons, she has blossomed into a prolific programmer in just a couple short years.\n\nIn addition to studying computer science at the College of Southern Maryland, Monique interns with Scratchwerk and regularly participates in hackathons. She has participated in XHacks 2021, TechTogether Seattle and Miami, Hoya Hacks 2022, and won category prizes at Girls Hoo Hackand HackViolet 2022. She continues to be involved with MLH, being a member of a Global Hack Week guild, and has also studied as part of Karlie Kloss\u2019 Kode With Klossy coding camp. Some of Monique\u2019s favorite memories have been in the hacker community, bonding with teammates and building long-lasting relationships, and she is always encouraging as many of her friends as she can to get involved with the hacker community.",

Currently an Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering student at Netaji Subhash Engineering College, she is also a regular in the Major League Hacking (MLH) community, competing in numerous hackathons and winning several. Her projects have included everything from a firefighting robot control unit to a modulated laser trip wire that prevents trespassing to automated street lights that save on energy consumption. For having attended her first MLH hackathon, Bitcamp 2021, just over a year ago, she\u2019s already amassed an impressive reputation as an active community member.\n\nDeblina grew up with a passion for hardware electronics, which drove her to pursue a career in technology. While she has always had a passion for creating, she says \u201cmy love for technology increased as my confidence in working with different hardware components kept increasing.\u201d Growing up in Kolkata, West Bengal in India, Deblina says she knows well the art of Jugaad: being crafty and innovating an often out-of-the-box solution to the problem at hand. For many of her hardware hacks, she says \u201cwe mostly made do with the items we had with us already.\u201d This skill certainly came in handy during the COVID-19 pandemic. To Deblina, \u201cbuilding hardware projects from scratch has a very unique sense of delight and satisfaction when completed.\u201d\n\nHackathons have been an important part of Deblina\u2019s continued growth as a hacker. \u201cHackathons gave me the platform where I could showcase my creations,\u201d Deblina says, adding \u201chackathons are a great place for gaining experience and getting exposure.\u201d One critical moment for Deblina was joining the MLH Community Discord, which helped her continue to grow in her career as an electronics and hardware enthusiast. She says that, during the COVID-19 lockdowns, it was \u201cbecause of MLH that\u2026unlike many others, I actually had something to look forward to every week.\u201d Deblina has made meaningful relationships with other hackers through MLH and over Discord, such as her friends in BLAHAJGang, where she says \u201cit feels like a family.\u201d\n\nShe has also participated in a number of Local Hack Days (now Global Hack Week), which she likens to a \u201cbreeze of fresh air on a hot sunny day.\u201d Deblina says her favorite part of Global Hack Weeks is getting to focus on learning and experimenting during those weeks instead of competing. To her, the experiences with Global Hack Weeks have functioned as a \u201cmuch-needed break for competitive hackers like myself who don\u2019t really understand their own limits and tend to overwork themselves.\u201d Deblina has worked on several projects addressing issues she is passionate about and is very proud of \u201cworking towards things that help the Earth along with humankind.\u201d She plans to stay involved in the hacker community by becoming a mentor and eventually organizing hackathons. And, of course, she plans to continue \u201ccontributing to open source and inspiring others to gain hands-on experience by building projects.\u201d",

    "about": "Akanksha Singh had a winding road to success in computer science. She has persevered and has served many important roles in the MLH community.\n\nA good teacher can influence a student\u2019s future; she was fortunate enough to have one in high school. That teacher encouraged her to explore computer programming, explaining the details so well that she mastered her coursework effortlessly. She realized her love of building and problem-solving would be ideal for a computer science major, so she launched into CS at her university.\n\nHer undergraduate journey was rockier than expected. She didn\u2019t have the guidance and support she\u2019d had in high school and briefly lost her programming focus, but she would rediscover it and major in CS.\n\nIn early 2020, Akanksha discovered hackathons. She saw their potential, but was hesitant to enter one. In the summer of 2020, she finally went for it. HackJaipur was her entry into Major League Hacking (MLH) hackathons, and the experience changed her entire outlook. At the hackathon, she and a friend created a mental health app called Dost, reviewing Flutter tutorials and working diligently to complete their project before the deadline. They ended up placing in the top 15 projects out of more than 200 submissions and winning the top all-girls team award. Akanksha\u2019s confidence in her technical skills and ideas was back.\n\nFrom then on, she entered hackathon after hackathon, winning several along the way. As she progressed through the events, her focus shifted, and she wanted to provide the mentorship she missed out on in her undergraduate years. Being a mentor and a judge at multiple hackathons gave her a platform to help other hackers and provide constructive criticism to improve their ideas. Some of the many events she judged or mentored at included HackHarvard, Hack BMU 5.0, Hack4Inclusion, and HackTheNorth, among others.\n\nHer drive and curiosity stayed strong, and she entered a Masters of Computer Applications program, where she dove into coding clubs, workshops, and hackathons. These accomplishments boosted her self-confidence and helped her pass her knowledge to others. Earlier in her career, she had doubts about her ideas, but her master\u2019s coursework, hackathons, and MLH rekindled her passion for CS. She says, \u201cI felt that my love for coding, which I had during my high school days, was back, and I started learning new programming languages, tech stack, and joined many tech communities.\u201d\n\nHer path to personal satisfaction took time and effort but paid off well. Besides judging and mentoring hackathons, she jumped into hosting workshops, including at KurinjiHacks, HackOdisha2021, and TechTogether Chicago 2022. She also organized an International All Girls Hackathon, impacting hundreds of young women, many of whom now plan to major in Computer Science. Through a hackathon, she even received an internship and a full-time offer from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.\n\nAkanksha\u2019s path has come full circle. She has evolved from hackathon attendee to mentor and judge to community event organizer. Coder Jedi, her YouTube channel, offers advice and resources to the entire hacker community\u2014just another way that she is paying it forward.",

    "about": "Jasmine Brown started coding at 10 years old after she discovered Scratch. \u201cI loved making little games and animations!\u201d she recalls. Her grandfather encouraged her interest by asking her to build a website about his garden. \u201cI really enjoyed the whole process of creating the website, especially getting to maintain it for a couple of years - I used to redesign the site and add more features like a virtual tour round the garden,\u201d Jasmine says. That\u2019s how the coding seed took root.\n\nWhen Jasmine\u2019s grandfather gifted her a Raspberry Pi, her love for computer technology grew. Jasmine used this to teach herself Python. Her love for languages and technologies flourished, and computer science quickly became her favorite subject. She eventually chose to study computer science at the University of Warwick.\n\nAs she neared her second year of university studies in 2021, she received a message from WarwickTECH. The team had reached out to Jasmine after hearing that she\u2019d be a good fit for the organization, and she joined the team as an associate.\n\nShe was soon offered the role of principal organizer, a key role that would require her to build the hacker community, organize Local Hack Days (now Global Hack Week), and spearhead the hallmark event known as WarwickHACK 2022. Not only was Jasmine brand new to the organization, but she also hadn\u2019t attended a hackathon before. \u201cI\u2019d been thinking about going to one for a while, but I was slightly apprehensive about whether I\u2019d fit in or what I\u2019d create,\u201d she explains. She took on an additional challenge by deciding to run a hybrid hackathon, which was a new idea for WarwickHACK and made it their first event with in-person participants in three years.\n\nJasmine sought guidance from the previous principal and from Major League Hacking (MLH). Armed with that support, she turned her focus toward recruitment. She thought creatively and reached out to prospective candidates via LinkedIn Recruiter. She recruited a team that reflected a diverse range of ethnicities, genders, and backgrounds. \u201cI passionately believe that anyone can (and should) get into tech, so it was really important to me to use my leadership position to promote diversity,\u201d Jasmine states. Most of the hackers hadn\u2019t been to hackathons, and many were beginners. \u201cIt was an exciting new experience for everyone involved!\u201d Jasmine says.\n\nJasmine loved seeing firsthand how technology and coding could be so collaborative: something especially meaningful for someone who was self-taught and has mostly worked on projects and assignments independently. Jasmine says that the best part of the weekend was \u201cgetting to speak to all of the different hackers, to provide guidance on their projects and share my own skills where I could.\u201d For example, she helped a couple of first-time hackers get to grips with Git. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to have had the opportunity to join and build the hacker community.\u201d\n\nJasmine\u2019s experience with this hackathon was truly life-changing. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have known that I could almost single-handedly run an event that 210 people would want to sign up for!\u201d she says. From liaising with sponsors, recruiting mentors and judges, securing funding, forming partnerships, and leading a team, Jasmine gained new skills and confidence. \u201cIt made me realize how much impact I could have on the tech community,\u201d she says.",

    "about": "Geetanjali Purohit has forged an exciting path, combining technical skills, logic, and exceptional creativity in her coding. She uses novel approaches and innovative ideas to create great things, finding solutions in unorthodox ways.\n\nBased in India, she is currently enrolled at university and heavily involved in Major League Hacking (MLH) hackathons, but has been interested in technology since she was a little girl. Whether it was creating Photoshop projects, wondering how people design websites, or analyzing how developers make games, she was always thinking about the creative side of technology. Her mother would work late, giving Geetanjali lots of time to work and play in the computer lab at school while she waited for her mom to pick her up.\n\nIn high school and college, her passion for technology combined with her love of the stage. She is outgoing and social and brings these parts of herself into her approach to coding. Before she participated in her first hackathon, she worked to build a culture of inclusivity. The role of engagement director in the hacker community was a natural fit, and she quickly focused on supporting women and non-binary hackers. Not only was she on the organizing team of gender-focused hackathons like Codetivate and Hydra Hacks, but she supported 30+ hackathons by mentoring newer hackers, hosting technical workshops, and running logistics behind the scenes. She was well aware of how hackathons work before she jumped into one.\n\nHack Girl Summer 2.0 was the ideal first hackathon. She created a solo project that allowed her to mesh her creativity with her technical expertise. It was called \u201cGender Bias Comment Detector,\u201d and used sentimental analysis on tweets to screen out gender bias and negativity. She won the best hardware hack in the hackathon. She recalls, \u201cHackathons found a special place in my heart as I got addicted to them over time, and I decided this is how I want to be learning for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nThis initial success became a springboard for committing to hackathons almost every weekend as a hacker and a mentor. Her engagement blossomed then and continues today, and she dedicates her time and energy to working with hackers of all backgrounds for mutual success. One friend she made through the TechTogether Boston Discord, for example, opened her eyes to different experiences. She recalls, \u201cit gave me a different perspective of the individuals in the queer space and hearing stories of how far individuals have come.\u201d\n\nGender disparity is a significant issue in technology, and Geetanjali is doing her part to close the gap. She became a guild leader for an MLH Local Hack Day that aimed to bridge the gender divide and built an inclusive group for high school girls to thrive in technology. Known as Command Tech, this initiative mentors young women from across the globe.\n\nGeetanjali has a natural gift for creativity and tech knowledge. Instead of using it only for personal gain, she shares her expertise and innovation with the hacker community, making her a truly valuable leader.",

    "about": "Jay Patel has an impressive resume, having attended more than 65 events as a hacker and mentor and organized more than 50 events, many as the founder of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute of Technology\u2019s hacking club, Hack Club SVIT. While he only competed in his first hackathon, Smart Gujarat Hackathon (SSIP) just over two years ago, Jay has since grown tremendously as a programmer and given back to the hacker community in many ways. He recently organized Hack SVIT, the first in-person Major League Hacking (MLH) event held in India since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. He has also organized a Flutter bootcamp for fellow SVIT students, aimed at giving students a deeper understanding than they would get from course instruction.\n\nBreaking into the hacker community wasn\u2019t always smooth sailing for Jay. Growing up in the city of Vadodara in Gujarat, India, Jay believes \u201conly 10-15% of students\u201d in the area are familiar with hackathons and the hacker community. After just a few months of learning web development and coding, Jay made his first foray into the hacker community by attending a local Google Developer Group. He was surprised to find he was the only undergraduate student in attendance, with the other group members all belonging to various businesses. Nevertheless, the other members and the group\u2019s organizers encouraged Jay to join. The experience inspired Jay, and he says, \u201cI wanted to join a campus-based or student community.\u201d\n\nWhile there was not a hacker community in place at SVIT when Jay arrived, he was dedicated to creating one. Jay says his biggest goal in founding Hack Club SVIT was to \u201cprovide a platform to the students.\u201d He saw the untapped potential of his fellow students first-hand at his Flutter bootcamp. When the guest speaker asked the attendees to raise their hands if they had completed their first app using Flutter, then if they were a first year student, Jay says he got \u201cgoosebumps.\u201d Despite none of the first year students who attended having taken any formal coding classes, the vast majority of the fifteen to twenty students who completed their Flutter project were first years.\n\nSeeing this inspired Jay to help students get an early start on their tech careers. Today, Jay says his club has \u201c25 active developers from their first-year who work with blockchain, MERN, Django, and other stacks.\u201d Continuing to grow, his club now takes on project assignments from both the university and local industry leaders, which Jay believes is a \u201cdramatic\u201d change for his university. \u201cAfter completing two years of my college, I achieved my dream to make a tech environment in my college,\u201d Jay says. Sharing the hacker community with so many others is Jay\u2019s way of giving back to the community from which he has learned so much. Jay has met hackers from across the globe, grown his professional career in programming, and even learned stronger English by participating in hackathons.",

And he\u2019s only 14 years old. He is a high school student in Colombia and has already compiled an astonishing list of accomplishments, learning various programming languages, creating social good, and moving through life with one goal: raising up others.\n\nHe started programming in late 2020 during the pandemic lockdowns. He stumbled upon it, recalling, \u201cI had nothing else to do besides school.\u201d Once he found out about this world, though, he didn\u2019t look back. He joined a Gamejam, a hackathon-like event centered around making games, prompting him to want to learn technologies like Python and git over the next several months.\n\nJuan has a competitive spirit that drives him. In August of 2021, he decided to enter a national event with zero knowledge of one of the critical requirements: programming in C. He bought a book from the local bookstore just three days prior to the competition and read as much as he could about C before diving headfirst into the contest. His effort got him second place in the entire country.\n\nThe competitions, technology, and hacking changed his life trajectory. Before he discovered MLH and other hacker communities, he navigated through school and life like a ship without a rudder. He says, \u201cI am autistic, and\u2026programming opened the door to an activity that I didn\u2019t get bored of and that I enjoyed so much.\u201d\n\nHis first hackathon was HackMTY 2021, and his experiences through MLH opened his eyes. His learning style, he says, \u201cis very different from other people\u2019s.\u201d New concepts are difficult for him to comprehend, but hackathons have framed them in a way he understands. He has grasped entire technologies exceptionally fast at hackathons, learning Svelte in just an hour at one of them. Other accomplishments in his long list of hackathon successes include learning React, Next.js, continuous integration, and blockchains as well as databases like Deta, CockroachDB, and MongoDB. One of his hackathon projects, CollegeLoans, directly led a company to hire him as a developer. He was also the Operations Executive at FreyHacks, a hackathon organized by high school students and is part of the MLH season.\n\nOne of the most critical ways technology impacted him was the connections and networks he built as a result. He has made friends from around the world with people who share his beliefs and have a drive to help others. His goal has been to help those struggling or underrepresented in his country through technology. So far, he has made quite an impact. He has channeled his talents into action by starting a nonprofit called ASOFI (Women's Association of Innovation for Rural Development). His organization helps find solutions through technology, allowing women of vulnerable populations to break the cycle of poverty and giving them tools to rise through and improve their situations.\n\nAll of these achievements would be impressive for a seasoned adult hacker, but Juan has done all this by 14, and his resume will only build from here.",

He studied computer science and telecommunications but found that side of tech a bit boring. The data structures and algorithms didn\u2019t engage him. In his third year, that all changed. Christos got into web and desktop development and realized he had found his calling. As he says, \u201cI was able to create something that the average user could use; that's what got me really passionate.\u201d He saw the potential for how his code could help others. That was a revelation that would change his direction.\n\nAs he began creating apps and software for public use, he saw how the community helped everyone involved. Through blogs, like dev.to and Medium, or sites, like StackOverflow and GeekforGeeks, he could stay in the heart of the community and contribute. One of the ways he uses his tech skills is to identify problems and develop solutions. He says, \u201cMost of the [time] when a company provides us with a product, there is nothing we can do if we don't like what they are doing with it. When it comes to software, you can create your own equivalent just for your personal use, or for your friends, or even everyone. That's the power that the hacker community has given me.\u201d\n\nChristos\u2019s first hackathon experience was during the Major League Hacking (MLH) Fellowship at the Orientation Hackathon, Spring 2022. He saw the power of teamwork and the commitment toward a common goal, and his team was one of the hackathon winners.\n\nAs a Fellow, he contributed to the Apache Ozone project, becoming an exceptional contributor. MLH set him up with G-Research, to contribute to Apache Ozone. At the start, he observed their operations and tried to understand the objectives. After a few weeks, he was working autonomously within the group. His main goal was to make it easier for new people to contribute to the project. His work led to G-Research offering him a full-time job as a software developer. He is expanding Apache Ozone today, improving the software and enhancing the tech community.\n\nChristos credits Major League Hacking with much of his success. Without the Fellowship he received from MLH, he wonders how his trajectory may have been different. He recalls, \u201cMLH did an amazing job matching me with G-Research and Apache Ozone. It was exactly what I wanted and what I was hoping to get out of this fellowship during my application.\u201d\n\nThough his time in the hacker community has been short, he has had promising contributions. His rise to Fellow has helped him professionally as well as the wider community. His focus is still on assisting others in accessing tech, and his work on Apache Ozone shows his commitment.",

Facing high and traditional standards in the\u00a0 tight-knit community she grew up with in Panadura, Sri Lanka, she had always believed her future lay in the field of medicine. However, in the midst of fighting depression, Zainab found herself at her lowest point, struggling to find direction without her childhood dream of studying medicine. She knew something needed to change, and \u201cafter hitting one of the lowest points in my life, I found my way through technology.\u201d\n\nInitially skeptical of the world of coding, Zainab realized early on the power technology has to shape lives. \u201cThe power to build, bring ideas to life, to solve real world problems, to be able to create a change\u201d motivates Zainab. In 2019, Zainab signed herself up for an inter-school hackathon. There, she took the opportunity to work on an application addressing issues close to home, including mental health, unemployment, and poverty. Zainab says \u201cthe power teens like us had in attempting to solve a real-life problem was truly a mind-blowing experience.\u201d While she did not place in her first competition, she found inspiration and a passion for hackathons which she still has today. From that very first hackathon in 2019, Zainab has gone on to compete in a number of online hackathons, including AthenaHacks in 2022. Working with a team of women from the United States and India, she says the hackathon has particular sentimental value to her.\n\n\u201cIn coding, I found my worth,\u201d Zainab says, continuing, \u201cI found the channel to show I can still achieve in life. I found a voice to tell others and myself [...] that things will get better.\u201d She says she wants to share that with others, since joining MLH\u2019s discord, she has \u201ctried to pay forward the kindness that I was shown in my first hack.\u201d\n\nShe has continued to pursue her passion for coding, and is currently enrolled in her first year of an undergraduate degree in Software Engineering from the University of Westminster. Her short-term goal is to apply for the MLH Fellowship this fall. As Zainab continues to grow in her hacking career, exploring the world of DevOps and familiarizing herself with Linux operations, she has kept her eye on the bigger picture.\n\nShe says \u201cas a Sri Lankan living through one of the country\u2019s worst economic crises, ranging from fuel and electricity to the food crisis, I want to show that despite those constant power cuts\u201d and the \u201ccrippling economy, we\u2014the future of Sri Lanka, will keep showing up.\u201d Bringing others into the hacker community, especially those who have not traditionally had the same opportunities to pursue a career in tech, is critical to Zainab, who says one of her biggest goals for the future is to \u201cshare this joy with so many more young women who believe their life is limited to raising a family.\u201d\n\nThe hacker community has had a profound impact on Zainab, and while her specific career goals have fluctuated from wanting to be a front-end developer to full-stack to DevOps, she\u2019s always kept focus on her primary goal of helping young girls with a background like hers find their way into technology. Zainab is leading by example, helping to set up a hackathon at her high school in order to give the next year of students the same life-changing hackathon experience she had. She has stayed involved by joining her university\u2019s chapter of Women in FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software), and says the one thing that won\u2019t change is her \u201cburning desire to reach out to so many young girls who I know would be saved and filled with purpose if only they had the opportunity.\u201d",

After teaching himself how to set up a Minecraft server on his dad\u2019s laptop, Toby wanted to share the experience with his friends. Learning to mod the server on the laptop and setting up port forwarding on the router was just the beginning of what has turned into a lifelong journey. By junior high, Toby was already creating functional websites using JavaScript and had been designated by his Boy Scouts troop as the in-house webmaster. After Toby taught himself to set up DNS, he decided to learn PHP to grow his web development skills further.\n\nHaving already found his niche at an early age, Toby applied for his local STEM magnet school seeking to gain practical experience in technology before beginning his career. The summer before he started high school, he discovered his other passion: teaching programming to others and sharing his passion for coding. Throughout the course of an eight-week summer camp, he taught Boy Scouts Java and Python, helping them earn their programming merit badge along the way. This skill would eventually prove useful at hackathons where Toby has often found himself bringing many friends and classmates new to hackathons, organizing teams of people new to coding and using the opportunity to teach them. Toby says it is \u201cincredible to have an opportunity to learn\u201d from veterans at hackathons but also \u201cto share my own knowledge and ideas with others.\u201d\n\nDiscovering the hacker community helped Toby tremendously with both of his passions. His freshman year of high school, his school hosted its first ever hackathon. Toby was unable to go, but hearing stories from his friends about how incredible the experience was motivated him to go to his first hackathon. Shortly thereafter, despite the COVID-19 pandemic shutting down in-person events for two years, Toby competed in the University of Virginia\u2019s virtual HooHacks 2021. The next year, Toby competed at Purdue\u2019s BoilerMake, Virginia Tech\u2019s VTHacks, the College of William and Mary\u2019s Cypher Hacks, and a second run at HooHacks, this time taking the gold with his team of rookie hackers. Growing his skillset by participating in dozens of Major League Hacking events, Toby has demonstrated his passion for hackathons.\n\nToby says technology has given him a \u201cwhole different path to follow in life\u2026 and hackathons have helped a lot with that.\u201d Recently, as an incoming university Freshman, Toby was selected for an internship, and he says \u201cit was actually hackathons that made me stand out as an applicant, because effectively everyone applying had the same good grades.\u201d He will be heading to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the fall to pursue a degree in computer science, and he plans to stay involved through the club that organizes HackRPI. Toby loves helping others at hackathons, teaching them to code and sharing his passion for technology, and he will no doubt continue leading the way as a mentor to young hackers just getting started.",

Her involvement in the tech world continues to expand, and she shares her passion and impact with the hacking community.\n\nShe got her start in web design during middle school when she lived in the Philippines. She enjoyed going above and beyond on her assignments, using HTML and CSS in her tech class to design and build websites. Although she learned some Python, she felt limited in her programming future until the day her family moved back to Silicon Valley. There, her curiosity flourished, learning as much as she could about the world of computer science. She joined women in tech groups, volunteered at the local technology museum, and even taught children how to build and program robots.\n\nIn her senior year of high school, Gabby joined her first hackathon: SuperPosition, Spring 2020. She was nervous and unsure of her ability to complete a major project, but she dove into the experience. She and her team built a web app that showed images of users\u2019 interests that provided emotional support, and the project got first place for the best web application. That was the push she needed. Since SuperPosition, she has participated in more than a dozen hackathons.\n\nCoding was not always effortless for Gabby. For various reasons, she was unsure about majoring in computer science in college. She says, \u201cI had stumbled upon previous tech \u2018hiccups\u2019 before - from struggling to grasp new programming languages to coping with impostor syndrome.\u201d\n\nHowever, she stuck with it and persevered, and hackathons were a significant motivation. She says, \u201cHacker events also teach me to persist - even if at the end of an event I don\u2019t win an award or I come across a huge error that halts my work, I continue to keep building and to problem-solve as much as I can.\u201dShe discovered a welcoming community and engaging platform to bounce ideas around and learn from others. Forming bonds with other hackers helped her thrive.\n\nGabby soon realized the power of tech could help her ignite social change. She formulated a plan by combining her hacking abilities and desire to help coders everywhere - especially newer ones - reach their goals. She launched a nonprofit called Helloo World, an organization that \u201caims to find the intersection between technology and social change through multimedia content, coding projects, and events.\u201d She and her organizer team built a hackathon from scratch, providing a place for new coders (60% of the attendees had never coded before) to collaborate and develop projects. It was a resounding success, and the organization plans to hold many more future events.\n\nBesides her nonprofit, Gabby has served as TechTogether\u2019s resident sticker designer. She was also a graphic designer and co-technical director of TechTogether New York, where she helped build the website for the event.\n\nShe appreciates the hacking community and the connections she has made through tech, and she is paying it forward with her nonprofit and continual involvement. As she says, \u201cI worked with my team to create our own little space in the hacker community.\u201d",

    "about": "Kanha Korgaonkar has loved his hacking journey. Although only actively involved in hackathons for a year, they have assumed a special role in his life. He has a passion for tech and a desire to bring others in to share his excitement, making him a valuable community member.\n\nKanha got into technology very early. His father taught him to create an HTML webpage in 3rd grade, and he was programming in C before he finished middle school. It was a dream. He says, \u201cComputer science felt almost magical to me. I was amazed how a few lines of code could make me a colorful website or do my complex math homework problems in a few minutes!\u201d\n\nHe credits hackathons for making computer science exciting and practical. He says much of the CS curriculum in his native India focuses too much on theory, which dissuades students from even considering it as an elective. Hackathons bring knowledge to life, and he wants to showcase them to everyone. He has a goal, he says, \u201cto get [his] school friends and as many other people as possible into hackathons!\u201d\n\nThroughout his schooling, he was involved in computer science and saw an ad for a hackathon in one of his massive open online courses. He saw it for what it was \u2013 a chance to apply his HTML, CSS, and CS fundamentals to hands-on projects. He signed up immediately. DefHacks Worldwide 3.0 was his first hackathon, leading him to sign up for over 50 more in the next year. His team of fellow beginners built a calendar app that won a sponsor\u2019s prize, showing him how collaboration and hard work could produce results.\n\nAfter several events, Kanha discovered Major League Hacking (MLH) and his first introduction to its hackathons: Hacky Birthday MLH. He described it as the most fun event yet, exposing him to a new world. He enjoyed \u201cthe mini events, streams and hacker hangouts, the support from mentors, cutting edge software for free from MLH\u2019s sponsors and cool stickers and swag! And, for the first time in my life, I found a welcoming, inclusive and empowering community I could truly fit right in!\u201d\n\nHis focus shifted from trying to win to supporting others in collaboration. Because he was participating in so many hackathons, his network was growing exponentially. He began to see his role shift from competitor to mentor. Even though he was new to the process, he knew he could help others. He says, \u201cI realized that mentors didn\u2019t have to know everything, but someone who is on Day 2 of their hackathon journey can be a very valuable mentor to someone who is on Day 1.\u201d Kanha understands the power of community, being able to lift others and guide them.\n\nThis mentoring push led him to lead his first guild, Maverick Mooshroom (now Makerspace), at Global Hack Week: Learn, Global Hack Week: Build, and Global Hack Week: Share. He continues to evolve, even organizing a hackathon himself, FreyHacks, that became an MLH Member Event and a nonprofit, fiscally sponsored by The Hack Foundation. It promotes STEAM and introduces hacking to diverse audiences.\n\nKanha understands the importance of giving back. He says, \u201cAs a hacker myself, I understand that great mentorship at the right time can be the difference between a hacker submitting a project or not, which is why I am really proud of what I do.\u201d",

    "about": "Ivanna Gomez Quiroz has followed her dreams and turned them into reality. Her tech journey is only beginning, and she is well on her way to enhancing the hacker community.\n\nWhen Ivanna was a child, she loved watching Star Wars. Spaceships flying across the galaxy and robots acting like people inspired her, leading her to jump into an Introduction to Aerospace class in her first year of college. However, she realized this was not her path: her path was coding. Her Star Wars inspiration had changed, not disappeared. She says, \u201cInitially I got sad at the realization that I would not be the one to design starships [but] I also realized that starships still need code!\u201d\n\nThis new motivation to pursue coding led Ivanna to hackathons. She discovered them in her first year of college but found them intimidating. In her second year, she found the courage to attend one. She was surprised by how welcoming everyone was at her first hackathon, HackGT, in Fall 2019, and she immediately assimilated into the community. She went from not completing a project in HackGT to winning the overall best project at the 2021 HackHer event.\n\nIvanna learned many lessons from her hackathon experience. She made mistakes, and she saw the support and camaraderie of the hacker community that helped her instead of discouraging her. She also saw how technology could influence all kinds of change and that tech can bring ideas to life.\n\nThis realization that her coding abilities could make an impact motivated Ivanna to do more. Her first move was to apply to TechTogether to join their team, and they selected her as Technical Director of TechTogether Atlanta. She was surprised but helped organize it flawlessly and saw the reward of putting on a successful hackathon, especially in the faces of the participants. She says, \u201cIt was truly heartwarming to see everyone having fun and attending the events that everyone worked so hard to organize.\u201d\n\nIvanna went on to apply to the MLH Fellowship, and in her brief time so far as a Fellow, she has thrived. She has found the fellowship supportive and is looking forward to working with the community in this new role.\n\nWith all these achievements, perhaps Ivanna\u2019s most impactful actions have been to support underserved hackers. She says, \u201cAs a first-generation student from a low-income household, a person of color, and a woman, I have struggled to find representation and find people I can relate to.\u201d As a result, her role in the community shifted from hacker to organizer with a goal to influence as many unsure hackers as she could to pursue a future in coding. She says, \u201cI hope that my story serves to inspire other people that will come after me and remind them that while it is not easy, it can be done.\u201d",

    "about": "Catherine grew up having multiple interests related to creative arts. At age 10, her parents enrolled her in several summer camps in her hometown of Tacoma, WA. Catherine found herself playing basketball and learning storytelling, but she felt most excited when she discovered Clubhouse 253, a computer science summer camp teaching Kodu Game Lab and Scratch.\n\nCatherine left the camp excited to keep building with Scratch, continuing her work on \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d games and custom platformers until her games received the ultimate recognition: being featured in a curated collection on the official Scratch website. Finding her passion, Catherine continued coding, eventually enrolling in her high school\u2019s Web Design class. There she found herself one of two girls in a class of twenty. Inspired by the demographic gap in her class, she says, \u201cI quickly made it my mission to debunk misconceptions about technology being a \u2018man\u2019s industry.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis realization led Catherine to start her high school\u2019s first Girls Who Code Club. There she works to encourage and empower the club\u2019s members and help them pursue their interests, often devoting herself to learning in-demand coding skills first so she can teach them to the entire club.\n\nAs she was watching tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to expand her coding skill set, one of the videos recommended coders attend a hackathon to test their skills and help others. So, in the summer of 2020, Catherine participated in her first hackathon: TaroHacks. She quickly realized how welcoming, fun, and supportive this community is.\u00a0 She joined forces with another hacker to build her first project, a website named School Tools meant to help its users find educational resources and record to-do lists. Her journey grew from there; today, she\u2019s participated in over sixty hackathons.\n\nWanting to share the knowledge and experience she gained at these events with other coders, she now volunteers as a mentor at the student-operated computer-science non-profit CodefyCS.\n\nShe\u2019s also used hackathons to address challenges in her own life. When her grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, Catherine said: \u201cI was devastated. I knew I had a small window of time before the disease would strip her of her bright personality and our shared, cherished memories. I knew I had to do something to help.\u201d\n\nDetermined to find a solution, she turned to technology. Catherine collaborated with her MLH teammates to participate in Tech Takes on Mental Health, a hackathon that focuses on cognitive science. She and her team created NeuroBoost, an app that is simple to use but effectively designed to help patients living with Alzheimer's improve their cognitive skills and continue to recognize faces. While most hacks don\u2019t continue past the hackathon, her grandma\u2019s caregiver started using NeuroBoost with great results. Catherine recalls, \u201cI was overjoyed when my grandma could recognize me more consistently.\"\n\nFor Catherine, she says, \u201cparticipating in hackathons has not only improved my technical skill set, but it has given me the ability to give back, share my passions, and build projects that truly help people.\u201d",

    "about": "Sohil Athare has done much for the hacker community in a short timespan. In only two years, he has gone full force into hackathons and achieved many successes all while in high school.\n\nHe grew up coding, beginning experimenting in sixth grade. He wondered how the websites worked and wanted to build his own solutions. He focused on learning programming languages, teaching himself with internet tools: mainly YouTube and Google. As his tech knowledge progressed, he moved into building web and mobile programs and apps, and that is what excites him most.\n\nSohil discovered hackathons and joined his first one, WinHacks, in Spring 2020. It was a virtual event, but he still made friends and found it an excellent introduction to the hacker community. Although he did not win the hackathon, he knew he had found something special and wanted more. Since WinHacks, he has entered over 15 events, winning 9 of them, including MHacks and PennApps, two of the world\u2019s oldest and largest student hackathons. He competed against college students in many of these events, and, as one of the top 200 hackers worldwide, he was invited to Pinnacle, the Olympics of hackathons.\n\nSohil quickly realized how he could give back to the community that had propelled him forward. He became a mentor with Major League Hacking (MLH) and assisted newer hackers at many hackathons, like Hack the North, Hack the Northeast, Sunhacks, and DandyHacks. He didn\u2019t stop there. He moved into organizing hackathons, becoming a leader in the community focused on helping newer hackers, mentors, and sponsors get together and thrive.\n\nHackathons have guided him down the path he\u2019s taken. He says, \u201cThey have changed my life by providing a pretty limitless amount of opportunities for me\u2026It has opened up quite a few doors in terms of my career, such as getting to know about opportunities in tech that are not posted elsewhere.\u201d All of the roles Sohil has had in hackathons contributed to his development.\n\nHis organizational involvement has catapulted him into leadership. At DefHacks 2021, he was the Head of Hacker Experience. He led logistical planning, the UI/UX sector, and outreach. His outreach efforts led to significant results, including securing guest speakers like Michael Siebel: the managing director at Y Combinator and the cofounder of Twitch.\n\nSohil is heavily involved in organizing TOHacks, where he set up a university panel and some mentorship programs. His next event, JAMHacks, a high school student hackathon, was the first in-person hackathon he organized. It was challenging and rewarding. He says, \u201cFrom being face to face with hundreds of hackers to coordinating in-person events during a power outage, it is safe to say that JAMHacks was an experience I'll never forget.\u201d\n\nSohil\u2019s passion for building led him to found Highlander Engineering, now Canada\u2019s largest high school engineering community. This year alone \u201cwe hosted over 30 workshops in software development, machine learning, robotics, and more to inspire over 200+ high school students in my community to pursue an interest in engineering!\u201d\n\nSohil is off to an impressive start in the hacker community. He remembers the support and encouragement he got as a participant, the opportunities he gained through mentorship, and the leadership skills from organizing hackathons and founding a community as he continues to pursue his own goals.",

    "about": "If you've been to an MLH digital event, you probably know Adam from his discord handle: Adam Drummond \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf2. Adam\u2019s love for technology began in the spring of 2014, when he was first introduced to it through the Isle of Man Code Club. Through the club, Adam learned to program in Scratch, Python, HTML/CSS, PHP, Java and JavaScript, and even taught a course himself in Visual Basic. The club empowered Adam and hundreds of other students to learn by doing. This steadily increased his love for technology until one day, seven years later, he became a team leader for a competition that he had competed in for six years.\n\nAdam\u2019s Local Hack Day, and indeed MLH, journey began in January of 2021. The Isle of Man had just entered a second lockdown after being COVID-free for six months. As a result, he was looking for a way to fill his time. Randomly, he received an MLH Hacker Newsletter suggesting he \"Ring In The New Year with Local Hack Day: Build.\u201d In Adam\u2019s words, he \u201cwas intrigued.\u201d He was one of the most invested hackers at LHD: Build 2021 (now Global Hack Week: Build), coming second by just two points, and was \u201cquite possibly the most active hacker in the Discord server.\u201d Adam took part in numerous events hosted by MLH after that, won a few prizes, and was thoroughly addicted.\n\nLocal Hack Day: Share came along, and Adam created the guild MELONsquad, competing directly with Jacklyn Biggin\u2019s BLAHAJgang. Eventually, the two communities merged after \u201can all-out melon vs. blahaj emoji [battle].\u201d What started as a Global Hack Week guild blossomed into a larger, long-term group with a Discord. The BLAHAJgang community\u2019s focus is on how they can make the experience of being in technology as fun as possible, exemplified by how they turned an IKEA shark into a meme and a movement. BLAHAJgang encourages teamwork and participation in hackathons and events like MLH Global Hack Week.\n\nAs an islander, Adam knows that working on the Isle of Man can sometimes be as difficult as it is amazing. Community events can be few and far between. As a member of Code Club, Adam looks to change this by organizing events and bringing people together. Adam is attempting to use his positions in MLH and BLAHAJgang to be an instrumental part of his local community. He still attends MLH events year round, and more recently, has been observing how these events run in hopes of one day running hackathons on-island as part of the Code Club. To this day, Adam loves to experiment with new technologies and ultimately have a fun time, while also empowering people of all ages to use digital skills and equipment to enrich their lives. He promotes this through Code Club by doing everything \u201c[from] using 3D printers, to programming on laptops, to creating electronics circuits that have a real purpose.\u201d\n\nFrom leading BLAHAJgang and organizing events, to hosting sessions at the Isle of Man Code Club, to empowering individuals and helping them learn, Adam\u2019s technology journey has certainly been one for the books.",

Her response was to come back and help the hacker community that taught her so much.\n\nSashrika had always been interested in technology since she played video games as a child and wondered how they worked, however her first coding experience was writing a Hello World program in her first year at university. There she used the resources available, took computer science classes, and saw the excitement and potential of technology.\n\nHer first hackathon, Hack InOut 2019, opened the floodgates. Although she didn\u2019t win, she had an incredible experience. The warmth and inclusivity of the hackathon participants made her feel at home. Feeling supported and confident, she applied her skills to win her second hackathon.\n\nAs Sashrika started hacking, she was worried, feeling unprepared and new to the coding world. She says, \u201cI was scared to participate in a hackathon since I thought I didn't know anything. The competition was fierce, and I never felt prepared enough. It was scary and overwhelming.\u201d Yet, she overcame her fear when a friend, who was experienced with hackathons, invited her to join their team and helped her look past her doubts.\n\nWhen she first got to college, she wanted a coding culture; somewhere she could learn new skills and find insights into the tech industry. But she wasn\u2019t sure how to get there until the hackathons. She was successful in them and, over time, she received scholarships and internships with groups like Google, Flipkart, and Goldman Sachs. Realizing she had a strong network, communicative colleagues, and the technical abilities for success, she moved from hacking into coaching. As an MLH Coach, she ensured \u201cthat hackers, organizers, and sponsors [had] an amazing experience\u2026attending our events.\u201d She credits Major League Hacking\u2019s Coaches Program for her global opportunities, networking experiences, and friends she\u2019s made along the way.\n\nSashrika has also been a technology evangelist at hackathons. Her pursuit to share tech with others has enhanced her experience as she has grown exponentially \u2013 personally and as an advocate. Sashrika helps hackers navigate digital and in-person hackathons, shares resources, speaks at various sessions, facilitates Q&A panels, and conducts 1:1 mentorships. Her primary focus is on helping those underrepresented in the field. She says, \u201cThe entry gate to tech shouldn't be this hard, and by sharing stories and experiences, the hope is to inspire more women in taking the leap of faith and exploring the tech career path for themselves.\u201d Her mentorship and guidance have expanded to other organizations, like Wootech, where they pair women with mentors to help them in their tech journeys.\n\nSince joining the hacker community, Sashrika has served as a judge, speaker, and mentor at many hackathons, including HackThisFall, HackOn, TechTogether Boston, Hack BMU, SheHacks, Bhilai Hacks, Hackulus, and SuperPOSITRON. She is also responsible for putting together each \u201cHosted by MLH\u201d digital hackathon, creating the schedule and events for every one.\n\nHer hackathon experience, networking, and upskilling led to a significant achievement \u2013 a full-time job as a software developer at Microsoft.",

    "about": "Firangiz Ganbarli first became interested in pursuing a career in technology in high school. She says her interest all began when she took a required ICT (information communication technology) course she excelled in. \u201cFor one section of this class, we had an introduction to Java and I was fascinated by the programming and coding side of Computer Science,\u201d Firangiz says. Pairing her fascination of coding with her childhood love of mathematics, she says it made perfect sense to apply for computer science programs for college. Almost immediately, she learned about hackathons and the incredible experiences they provide, especially for hackers just starting off.\n\nUnfortunately, at the time she was launching her career in technology, it was exceedingly difficult for Firangiz to participate in hackathons. Growing up in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, Firangiz didn\u2019t have regular opportunities to attend hackathons. Until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, opportunities to attend hackathons were few and far between. It was only after many of these events transitioned to a virtual format that she was able \u201cto attend hackathons, workshops, and tech talks.\u201d\n\nThese new opportunities were crucial for Firangiz, who says the transition to virtual formats with the onset of the pandemic \u201copened many doors for me, one of them being able to come and study in the United States, where I had more physical access to the hacker community.\u201d She earned a full-ride scholarship to the University of Kansas and was able to attend her first hackathon, Neural Hacks, the summer after she graduated high school. The event focused on AI for social good, so Firangiz built an augmented reality app for iOS, iPhones for Seniors, which helps the elderly navigate the often-complicated world of smartphones. While she won the hackathon for her work on the app, she felt a strong desire to collaborate with other hackers from around the world, so when she discovered MLH, she knew she had found her community.\n\nParticipating in several MLH member events, including Hack the 6ix, VandyHacks, and ShellHacks, Firangiz found that hackathons were her \u201cideal place to play around and learn new technologies and frameworks.\u201d Having had such positive experiences at hackathons herself, Firangiz wanted to find ways to give back to the hacker community by helping to organize hackathons for other young hackers. First, joining the club that organized HackKU and working as an Events and Logistics organizer in 2021, she was named the Head Organizer for HackKU 2022. Through the experience, she was able to work with other hackers, network with sponsoring companies, and even earn herself a competitive internship with Microsoft.\n\nTo Firangiz, \u201cthere is a great responsibility for an organizer to make sure hackers [both] enjoy and get something out of their hackathon experience.\u201d Hearing from attendees that their HackKU experience had been important in job interviews and had made a difference to other hackers made a lasting impact on Firangiz. She has stayed involved in the hacker community and is now the president of the University of Kansas\u2019 chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) as well as an organizer for Women in Computing, KU events in the Lawrence, Kansas area. She hopes to help empower the next generation of women in technology by teaching Python.",

Her compassion for the community is evident in everything she does, and because she wants to give back to that community, she continually shares her knowledge with others.\n\nIn childhood, Grace enjoyed expressing herself through blogs and would enthusiastically customize her website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Her first computer science class in 10th grade, however, dashed some of that enthusiasm. Because she felt alienated by that group, she dedicated herself to supporting the broader highschool community. She remembers, \u201clunchtimes were for learning new things, volunteering, or participating in student club initiatives that benefited the community.\u201d Tackling social justice issues and school club administration became her priorities. She realized that she wanted to turn her challenges into lessons other kids could learn from, but realized that, to do so, she would have to confront her past discomfort.\n\nAccordingly, in September 2020, she rejoined the computer technology community in her first hackathon, Wonder Women Tech\u2019s\u00a0Hacks 4 Humanity. She had an incredibly positive experience, feeling accepted, valued, and treated with patience and understanding. As a result, her team\u2019s project won 2nd place! That welcoming community feeling was what she had been seeking, and she wanted to keep it going.\n\nHackathons kept her at the top of her technology game, but more important was the sense of pride and contribution she felt. She says, \u201cI used to underestimate myself, [but] Hackathons were my way of meeting others, being able to apply the skills from the theory that I had learned in class to relevant applications that excited me (with large potential to make an impact!) and [they] opened my perspective to the world around me.\u201d She had found her place.\n\nShe has attended many Major League Hacking (MLH) hackathons and enjoys the friendships she makes, the interactions with like-minded hackers, and the lessons she learns along the way. She has acquired both technical and people skills through her hackathon experiences. Many of the speakers at hackathons inspire her with their stories of overcoming obstacles like hers.\n\nCommunity organizing is another strong point for Grace, one she thanks MLH for encouraging. As an events operations manager with eHacks, she has grown as a planner, teammate, and leader. She continues to explore her strengths and needs, and how she can use that knowledge in her tech journey.\n\nWith her \u201cpositive growth mindset,\u201d she has channeled early hardships into making a positive impact. She started a nonprofit, Youth180, that supports middle, high school, and early university students and provides crucial resources to help them achieve their dreams. Today, her posts have surpassed 2.5 million views on TikTok, and she mentors numerous younger hackers, especially girls, counseling them on how to reach their technology goals. For example, she posts about opportunities for free learning certifications for Microsoft Azure courses and events for girls in tech, like RBC Code Crunch and Tesla\u2019s Girls in Engineering Day.\n\nBy paying it forward, Grace has become much more than another hacker community member. She is a counselor, a source of inspiration, and a guide for others on their journeys.",

    "about": "Caijun Qin is all about finding solutions through technology. Since he discovered coding and computer science, he has challenged himself to create and innovate.\n\nHe took his first computer science class, Computer Science Principles, in his senior year of high school. From that point on, he immersed himself in the world of programming. The course was based on a prepared curriculum from code.org, and he immediately became deeply immersed in its project-based learning using JavaScript. Wanting to learn more, he took it a step beyond what the course required. He says, \u201cI implemented features beyond the rubric requirements just to explore the programming language further.\u201d This habit of going above and beyond expectations would drive his success.\n\nCaijun was born in Shandong, China. However, most of his tech growth happened in the United States. As a freshman at Florida State University, he jumped into a Computer Science major, learning programs like C++. His CS education took off with a successful start at FSU\u2014he had a 4.0 GPA and was part of the University Honors program. Still, he was missing something. He felt fulfilled when he worked closely with colleagues, but he recalls, \u201cas I coded more and more, I realized that focusing on real-life inspired projects was more in line with my style.\u201d\n\nPursuing greater opportunities, he transferred to the University of Florida. Once again, he thought the program should be focusing more on essential industry tools of software engineering. In his junior year, he found the solution that brought it all together: hackathons. His first hackathon, SwampHacks VII, opened his eyes to the potential of the hacker community. UFL orchestrated many of his early hackathons, connecting him to peers with common interests. Before, much of his CS education had been individual, as he explored what he could accomplish alone. Through hackathons, he began to see hacking as a team effort. He says, \u201cI realized team culture was the most important aspect of how successful the end product was [\u2026] the hacker community also taught me how important maintaining connections with hard-working hackers is.\u201d\n\nAttending more than 50 hackathons in his university career, Caijun gained practical knowledge. He became adept at using tools like Docker, CircleCI, Google Cloud, and various GitHub features. At RUHacks 2021, he used his growing knowledge and skill set to create PowerSearch, a project that refines search data into practical information his fellow students can use. It won Best Use of DataStax Astra. As his interest in machine learning and data science grew, he learned to use other tools like Streamlit and Scikit-Learn in his hackathon experiences.\n\nMLH has contributed to Caijun\u2019s growth as a coder not only by supporting his hackathon experiences, but by bringing together a community of hackers\u2014he credits Discord servers like the MLH Discord with getting him active in the coding community. Beyond showing him teamwork and collaboration, hackathons have catapulted him to leadership positions in the hacker community. Inspired to spearhead new projects, he has taken several technical officer roles in student organizations on campus. He was a Project Lead for Open Source Club, mentoring newer CS majors in Python application development and GitHub tools. He was also part of the core officer team of his school\u2019s Google Developer Student Clubs chapter, creating teams for the Google Solutions Challenge.\n\nCaijun has a knack for finding innovative solutions to difficult problems. His hackathon experience, campus leadership, and appreciation for the hacker community contribute to his ongoing success.",

    "about": "As soon as Nikhil Vytla begins recounting his connection to computer science, his passion is evident. Some hackers blossom later in their academic careers, but not Nikhil: he was still just a child when he first fell for technology. While in elementary school, he was a fan of robotics (he says, \u201cperhaps from watching Transformers too much!\u201d) and space exploration. Ever since, he has been blazing his path through the hacking world, building upon his early curiosity to follow his technological dreams.\n\nAt his first hackathon as a high school junior, VikeHacks 2017, he saw the potential of combining his sense of humor with his newfound interest in game development. He and his friends successfully created a game, but the real success was in their hilarious presentation. They had the audience laughing endlessly as they compared their glitches to high school struggles, and that moment, he says, changed his path. \u201cSomething that had been a mere thought a day earlier was now a tangible experience that brought joy, however temporary, to people's lives. [\u2026] I continue to strive to build experiences that engage my peers, and experiences that bring joy to the communities around me.\u201d\n\nSince VikeHacks, Nikhil has been a part of the hacker community in various ways. He has been a competitor in many events, an organizer on four occasions, and a three-time MLH Fellow.\n\nAs a participant in HackDuke 2019, he built FloodGate, a responsive natural disaster early warning and detection app to alert communities to rising floodwaters in real-time using remote sensor-based and crowd-sourced data. Since FloodGate, he has created many complex hacks applying technology he learned through hackathons, including Flask, the Twilio API, ngrok, Arduino, Cloud Firestore, and SQLite3.\n\nAs an organizer of hackathons like HackNC, HackDSC, and more, he understands the depth and interconnectedness of the hacker community. The support, camaraderie, and enthusiasm that organizers exude keep bringing him back. He sums it up, saying, \u201cit\u2019s the ability to collaborate effectively and work efficiently together as a team that helps enable hackathons, both large and small, to be such incredibly high-energy, dynamic events.\u201d\n\nHis experience as an MLH Fellow has been especially gratifying. As a Production Engineering Fellow with Facebook/Meta in the summer of 2021 he learned strong DevOps skills, supported once again by a strong community, \u201cmany of us didn't know how to use Docker, or Nginx, or how to write Bash commands that didn't crash. But through all of our trials and tribulations, through our frustrations with docker-compose and port forwarding and debugging service failures, we grouped together and continued to support each other.\u201d Through his next MLH Fellowship, as a GitHub extern, he was able to learn about sustainable engineering practices within GitHub Enterprise and even share his knowledge of accessibility in team presentations and 1:1s with senior managers at GitHub.\n\nHis involvement as an MLH Fellow also illuminates his overarching purpose in coding: healthcare and accessibility. Nikhil has an extensive background in developing code and software to benefit those with chronic health conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and lingering ankle instability. His focus on accessibility is razor-sharp. When he creates, he does so with accessibility and equity at the forefront of his mind, and it shows. He has pushed for equal access for underrepresented populations throughout his career, including during his time at Meta, Impact Labs, and Amazon Web Services. At AWS, he authored 8-page accessibility reports and playbooks with actionable insights to improve EC2 web console experiences for developers with disabilities, showcasing his dedication to what he believes.\n\nPerhaps that is what stands out most from Nikhil\u2019s lengthy list of achievements. He has a dynamic and prolific resume full of remarkable accomplishments\u2014including time as an ML infrastructure engineer at TruEra, President at CS + Social Good, and his many internships and Fellowships. Even more impressive is his desire to give back to the MLH community and his family, and to speak for those whose voices are not heard.",

    "about": "Faris Ashai has a talent for coding and a drive to create new opportunities for the hacker community. Whether working alongside his teammates in hackathons or organizing a brand-new event, he embodies the hacker community\u2019s collaborative spirit.\n\nFaris grew up immersed in novel technology. His first introduction to tech was through gaming consoles and portable devices (he still owns his first-generation iPad). His first coding experience was in 8th grade, using GameMaker to create video games in class. He saw the rewards of creating something from scratch and putting puzzle pieces together to complete projects. His interest in coding has only grown since then.\n\nFaris\u2019s love of project-based learning was a perfect fit for hackathons. Though he knew computer science was his passion when he started college, he was unsure how to practically apply his skills. His cousin suggested hackathons as a unique and engaging event to work on hacking with a team, so he joined his first event, HolidayHacks, in December 2020. Even though he and his team had no practical experience with web development, they rallied together to create a functioning project. He says, \u201cI found the experience very rewarding, to see that I could create something visible for people on the Internet to interact with, and became further motivated to do more serious projects in the future and compete in additional hackathons.\u201d\n\nHis interest in coding flourished in his second year as he joined more hackathons and branched out into new technologies. In his second hackathon\u2014SDHacks 2021\u2014he discovered React, which he used to build more dynamic front-end projects. React was a springboard for Faris, giving him a space to apply his skills and broaden his coding knowledge.\n\nCompeting in hackathons was exciting, but Faris wanted more. He saw that hackathons can have a crucial impact on budding programmers, so he moved into organizing them. He joined the organizing team of a new event called TritonHacks, aimed at high schoolers and specifically underprivileged students. The next year, Faris stepped into the role of director. He focused on supporting new coders by supplying participants with high-quality starter kits. Even if coders attended TritonHacks with no experience, Faris says, \u201cthey still feel the rewarding experience of completing a project.\u201d Faris also pushed mentorship as a primary focus, aiming to give underrepresented hackers a place to thrive through tutoring and individual tech support. He says his goal at TritonHacks is \u201cto help provide disadvantaged communities with the same opportunities and representation in STEM fields.\u201d Each participant is assigned a mentor, regardless of skill level, and they can instantly feel like part of a community.\n\nFaris overcame many obstacles in his leadership of TritonHacks, including self-doubt, lack of experience, financial issues with sponsors, and internal team issues. However, stayed focused on his mission: giving students, particularly high schoolers, a safe place to code and learn as much as possible.\n\nHackathons are more than just engaging eventsFaris believes they can alter hackers\u2019 lives. He says, \u201cI knew [TritonHacks] had the potential to completely change the career trajectory of some of these students if they came away from the experience with new skills and enjoyed it enough to come back again.\u201d He knows that TritonHacks will inspire many students to learn more about computer science, and will create positive changes in their lives, because when he joined the hacker community, he says, \u201cthat\u2019s exactly what happened to me.\u201d",

    "about": "From 2017 to 2022, the gender diversity of the hackathon community increased from 18% to 46%, proof that hackers of underrepresented genders are continually making space for themselves in the world of tech. One of the central figures behind this shift is Fiona Whittington.\n\nFiona grew up building websites and writing basic programs, but found most of her coding projects stale and solitary. Her introduction to hackathons changed everything. HackNYU 2017, her first hackathon experience, was a 200-mile solo expedition from home. While this event propelled her into the hacking world, and she enjoyed the experience overall, it wasn\u2019t all positive. She noticed a glaring gender disparity, and another coder even questioned her skills because she was a woman. Instead of discouraging her, this event lit a fire in her that continues today. Her mission? To create a hacking space where people of all gender identities can feel comfortable, supported, and ready to thrive.\n\nAfter her first year at Boston University, Fiona felt disoriented and unsure of her path. In her sophomore year, she joined the hacker community and started attending hackathons regularly, and realized she had found her place. She credits the BU hackathon organizers with giving her life focus. She says, \u201cNo matter what time it was or what I was going through, these organizers were there for me. I don\u2019t think I would have gotten through college without them, and I definitely wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without their support through all the ups and downs.\u201d\n\nFiona\u2019s passion, dedication, and moral commitment led her to create TechTogether, an organization aiming to increase the representation of people of marginalized genders in hackathons. The hacker community inspired her and carried her through challenging periods, and she wanted to provide the same support to hackers everywhere. Her first step was to organize SheHacks Boston, a direct response to her experience at HackNYU2017.\n\nThrough TechTogether, Fiona has created a platform for underrepresented hackers. TechTogether\u2019s mission includes serving people of \u201call gender identities which have been systematically oppressed by those in power throughout history.\u201d She points out that her pathway was unconventional, and she does not fit the typical mold of a hacker. She says, \u201cI\u2019m a female, [...] queer, not a computer science student, not even pursuing a career in tech!\u201d None of these are deficits, and she knows it. She is proud to \u201credefine the stereotype\u201d through her organization\u2019s work.\n\nTechTogether\u2019s impact benefits those that need it most. As she says, \u201cI believe we\u2019ve been able to start so many important conversations about diversity beyond gender that have had a long-lasting impact on the hackathon community. I\u2019m especially proud of our work that has resulted in cultivating safer spaces for LGBTQ+ hackers in our community, and in others.\u201d\n\nTechTogether and Major League Hacking (MLH) intertwine in many ways (now more than ever, as MLH recently acquired TechTogether), and Fiona understands the importance of that bond. MLH supports so many hackathons with resources, guidance, and expertise, and she is grateful. More than logistical support, she knows that TechTogether and MLH both share \u201cstrong values and a community-centric approach.\u201d\n\nFiona responds to inequality with action, and her work has had a lasting effect. As she says, \u201cTechTogether has changed so many people\u2019s lives, and if it ended today\u2014our impact would live on for years to come.\u201d",

Seeing it as a way to level the playing field for all, she realized it could be her path to creating real-world change\u2014and she has done just that.\n\nNishtha attends the Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW), where much of her experience in the hacker community has taken place. She began coding in her first year and immediately saw its appeal. Creating code, engineering solutions to problems, and working together to innovate are all parts of what attracted her to technology. Her approach to coding is to use it as a tool for social good, to connect people no matter where they come from or what they believe. As she says, \u201cOne of the reasons I like technology so much is that it treats everyone equally. Gender biases, religion, caste, or creed have little bearing on the availability and benefits of technology.\u201d\n\nShe jumped into the world of hackathons in the fall of 2019, participating in the Microsoft Imagine Cup. That first experience catapulted her into many more, as she thrived learning new technologies, collaborating with other hackers, and joining diverse communities of people from different backgrounds.\n\nNishtha\u2019s competitive run in hackathons has been impressive. She has won more than ten hackathons, achieved third place out of more than 80,000 participants in the Flipkart GRiD 3.0 event, and achieved first place in the VMWARE CAP Hackathon. Through her connections and successful ventures in the MLH community, she became an MLH Fellow and even landed a Software Engineering internship at Google, further boosting her resume.\n\nOne of the most transformative moments for her tech journey was when she and three hacker friends founded a university technical club named Celestial Biscuit IGDTUW. Her focus has always been on creating positive change, and this was a chance to act on it. Celestial Biscuit IGTUW mixes technology and innovation to improve student lives on campus, benefiting the entire community. It is open-source, giving all students the option to contribute and collaborate.\n\nShe also is the Management Lead of Google Software Development Clubs IGDTUW, through which she and her team organized a hackathon that anyone could participate in, acting on her belief that technology should be available to everyone. This hackathon was part of a larger event that her group put on called DEVCATION\u201922. There were several components to this technology festival, including a designathon, an ideathon, the hackathon, and smaller events, each aiming for equality and accessibility for all students.\n\nBeyond the tech stacks and coding expertise she has gained during her career, Nishtha has stayed true to her roots and her family. She credits her mother for her success, because she consistently encourages Nishtha to be the best she can be. As she says, her mom \u201cis the one who anchored my identity, shaped my mind, influenced my beliefs, and made me who I am.\u201d\n\nCommitment to equity and fairness in technology is just part of Nishtha\u2019s focus. Her sense of community, dedication to her family, and appreciation of diverse voices and backgrounds continue to drive her success.",

    "about": "Jorge Sanchez of Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico is a longtime hacker, who first developed a passion for technology when he was just 4 years old. He recalls being awestruck by his first Xbox console, and becoming deeply curious about how it actually worked. That curiosity led Jorge to pursue a career in technology, completing two Unity programs while still in high school. Those programs opened his eyes to just how broad the field of technology is. Jorge, who admits to sometimes being too inquisitive, was inspired by the vast world of programming. From cybersecurity and data science to artificial intelligence and DevOps, Jorge says he \u201cwill never be bored because there will always be something new to learn.\u201d\n\nAs someone with a constant drive to learn more about the world of programming, hackathons proved the perfect environment for Jorge to grow and develop his craft. He attended his first hackathon, HackMTY, in 2018. \u201cI had never been to a hackathon before,\u201d Jorge says, \u201cso I was super nervous.\u201d Despite being brand new to hacking, he was determined to get involved in the hacker community, so he convinced several of his friends to join him on the 12 hour drive from Guadalajara to Monterrey for HackMTY.\n\nNot only was their team able to complete and deliver their project during the hackathon, but Jorge says this was his first run-in with Major League Hacking. He was awarded a Major League Hacking (MLH) sticker which read \u2018I Demoed\u2019. Jorge says he was \u201csuper proud\u201d of the sticker he had earned as recognition for his work, and he displayed it on his laptop. While admitting he \u201cknew nothing about programming\u201d when he first started his undergraduate degree at the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, he was inspired by a friend, who was interning with Microsoft and had participated in several MLH hackathons, to get more involved with the hacker community. Jorge applied for the competitive MLH Fellowship, making it to the last round but not ultimately being selected. The next year, Jorge applied again and was waitlisted, before applying a final time and making it all the way through in 2021. Jorge completed both the Production Engineering and Open Source tracks of the MLH Fellowship\u2019s 12 week program, and believes \u201cthese two opportunities have changed my life.\u201d\n\nNow, Jorge strives to give back to the hacker community in any way he can. At his university, he founded Club Algoritmia GDA, which helps students prepare for the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) by hosting workshops, guiding students through interview preparation, and offering help with students\u2019 resumes and portfolios. In just a couple of years, the club has expanded from 7 members to over 300. Around 40 members of the club have earned internships at top tech companies. The messages of gratitude Jorge has received for his work with Club Algoritmia keep him inspired and push him to drive change in the hacker community. The words of gratitude in those messages are \u201csimply something that I will never forget and that I will always carry in my heart,\u201d Jorge says.",

She\u2019s paying it forward to others in similar situations and inspiring many along the way. Her journey is one of breaking barriers, to \u201cdemonstrate to other hackers (particularly women and women of color) that despite their background or rough starts, they, too, can reach their goals.\u201d\n\nUp until her senior year of high school, Governess wanted to be a vocal performer. In 12th grade, a teacher inspired her to pursue a STEM major instead of Vocal Performance in college, telling her that she showed potential to be a great engineer. She reflected and committed to a future in computer science, but it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing; she felt a connection with coding but struggled in introductory classes. However, she hit the real obstacle in her sophomore year, when she was rejected from the Computer Science major at her university. Many people would have given up at that point, but not Governess. She says, \u201cDespite my initial setback, I was still motivated to succeed in this field and carve a path for myself and others in a similar situation.\u201d\n\nShe fostered connections, creating a social network of like-minded people interested in technology. Her \u201caha\u201d moment came in 2018, when she participated in her first hackathon, MinneHack. She fondly recalls, \u201cI was nervous about competing and that I\u2019d be a fish-out-of-water, but everyone was incredibly welcoming, and the energy in the space was electrifying.\u201d Her first Major League Hacking member event was a resounding success, and she hasn\u2019t looked back, participating in and hosting many hackathons since.\n\nShe blossomed into a natural leader and role model. After her rejection from Computer Science, she found solace and comfort in her hacking family, and that feeling continued in hackathons and her role as an MLH Localhost Organizer. Her talents have truly shined since she became a student leader in Black Wings, which supports black women studying technology and engineering in college. Organizing Black Wings Hacks, which gives women of color access to unique networking opportunities, has helped drive her enthusiasm and compassion.\n\nTo Governess, community is everything. She recalls being doubted by some when she tried to break into Computer Science, but also the overwhelming reassurance and guidance she received from her various communities. Feeling the support and encouragement she did when she was down on her luck was not enough: she wanted to give others the same confidence. Her work with Black Wings and her participation in MLH hackathons are focused on helping others and nurturing relationships.\n\nShe says, \u201cThe hacker community (and hackathons in general) gave me direction and guidance [\u2026] I found confidence, reassurance, and belonging. Now I want to create those spaces for others in technology. That\u2019s my calling.\u201d",

    "about": "Mansi Saini knows something about commitment. Whether it is a personal challenge to learn a new skill, a chance to rise to leadership roles, or an opportunity to dedicate her time and energy to helping new hackers, she gets it done.\n\nHer journey began in high school through the Girls Who Code web development course. Her curiosity in computer science ignited, and when she discovered a link to her first hackathon in a Girls Who Code alumni newsletter, she was off to the races.\n\nAt Creatica 2020, where she and her team of friends built a website to guide high school students\u2019 paths to college, she realized she was hooked. She recalls, \u201cIt was a rewarding experience to see what hackathons are like and how awesome the community truly is.\u201d\u00a0 Her dedication to computer science and technology didn\u2019t slow down there. At the end of 2020, she entered TechTogether New York\u2019s hackathon, working with partners across the country to develop a Google Chrome extension to keep kids engaged during virtual learning. It took her 36 hours of non-stop coding to finish, but this intense commitment only fueled her fire.\n\nHer first hackathon win came early. Mansi won Best UI/UX hack at Rose Hack in January 2021. Recalling the win, she says, \u201cI was completely in shock\u2026here I was learning, coding, designing, and somehow winning a hackathon.\u201d It was then her mindset began to change. Although she proceeded to win and place near the top in many more hackathons, she found a new passion for leadership and mentoring others: a way to give back to the community. She realized, \u201cThe most valuable parts of my hackathon experiences are the friendships and industry knowledge that I have gained.\u201d Mentorship and coaching seemed a natural transition.\n\nHer main pathway to mentorship was through TechTogether. She attended many hackathons (most of which were TechTogether events) back-to-back in 2021 where she enjoyed the experience and learned plenty, but she also witnessed a welcoming feeling of community. She joined the mentor network in the fall of 2021 and continues to mentor at each TechTogether event today. Mansi took on other leadership opportunities when she joined the organizing team for Hydrangea Hacks in June 2021 where she helped oversee the 706-person event. One of her biggest roles has been as an MLH Coach in which she serves as a \u201chackathon superhero,\u201d mentoring hackers, debugging code for teams, leading the judging process, and helping events run smoothly.\n\nAs far back as her Girls Who Code days, Mansi saw the importance of compassion and inclusion. She appreciated the value of a relaxed and safe coding space and enjoyed working with only femme and non-binary individuals early in her career. She now mentors that same population through TechTogether hackathons and sees it as her way to give back to her community. Many organizations she has partnered with have formed to include marginalized or underrepresented hackers, such as the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT), Tech Ladies, and the UCSC Society of Women Engineers Club.\n\nHer dedication and willingness to achieve her goals perfectly sums up her hacking trajectory. Whether she is coaching, mentoring, challenging herself to learn new technologies, or encouraging new community members, she will put her all into it.\n\nHaving participated in all stages of hackathons, from recruit to coach, Mansi has exemplified her determination, drive, and focus of her coding passion. And in doing so, she has continued to share that passion with other like-minded hackers.",

    "about": "Akshay Akula grew up with a passion for creating things, but never imagined himself as a programmer. He recalls building a rudimentary motor using a magnet, paper clips, and some copper wire in the 3rd grade, and the feeling of \u201cpure wonder\u201d at watching it burst into motion. By the time Akshay graduated high school, he was dead set on pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering at Virginia Tech. At the time, Akshay says the only coding he knew was basic Java.\n\nFreshman year is always full of surprises, however. While Akshay was eating in his university\u2019s dining hall, his friend and former soccer teammate, Naman Singh, approached and invited him to participate in his first hackathon, VTHacks. Akshay says he \u201crelentlessly learned Java\u201d in the two days left before the event. Inspired by mentors at the hackathon, who he says \u201cwere like my idols,\u201d Akshay changed his major to computer science and hasn\u2019t looked back.\n\nCrediting his first hackathon experience with being \u201cthe one event that imparted in me the confidence and knowledge that I can build anything if I put my mind to it,\u201d Akshay was hooked. He attended the Virginia Commonwealth University\u2019s 2019 HealthHacks shortly after. In the last three years since attending his first hackathon, Akshay has won both VTHacks and HooHacks, and competed in many other hackathons, including DevRev, Chainlink Hackathon, and Polkadot Hackathon.\n\nAkshay says although he loves competing in hackathons, his \u201creal draw is the ability to teach and help others with coding.\u201d The summer after his freshman year of college, when Akshay first decided to teach coding to new hackers, he left posters advertising free Java tutoring all over his neighborhood. Akshay\u2019s first student was nervous and struggled with confidence in his coding, but Akshay persevered and changed his lesson plan completely, letting his student draw out blocks of code to understand how they worked. He has since found other ways to share his love for coding, encouraging others to attend hackathons and even teaching full stack development on the side. Akshay says he just loves to see people \u201crealize their ability to build.\u201d To him, helping to build a hacker community at Virginia Tech has been the \u201cmost powerful and fulfilling form of building.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hacker community means so much to me,\u201d Akshay says, adding \u201cI want to be like the mentors who inspired me.\u201d Wanting to be more involved with the hacker community, he founded the club Blockchain at Virginia Tech, which already boasts more than 100 active members. Next year, Akshay\u2019s club will be hosting its first hackathon, which he says will be \u201cfocused on blockchain development and learning.\u201d Despite the club starting only recently, in September of 2021, it has grown tremendously over the last ten months. Blockchain at Virginia Tech has already partnered with five local corporations, participated in more than twenty events, and placed 2nd in Blockchain@Columbia\u2019s LionHACK. To date, however, Akshay believes the club\u2019s biggest accomplishment has been \u201cmaking lifelong connections and discovering and sharing our spark for blockchain technology.\u201d",

While he fixed electronic devices all the time growing up in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, he specifically recalls that it was when he fixed his first laptop while still in middle school that he knew the direction he wanted to go with his career. In high school, Gedion began taking advanced programming courses, and soon realized he had a knack for coding. Toward the end of high school, even though Gedion was already well prepared for the software engineering program he would begin at the Addis Ababa Science and Technology University after graduation, he \u201cwanted to try something new and learn something different\u201d than what was taught in class.\n\nThough he did not feel qualified to participate in his first hackathon, ETHIOHACKS, in 2018, hackathons seemed like a perfect place to learn, and Gedion even managed to take second place for his project. Gedion says \u201cthe people I met and the experience itself was so inviting that I [have] been involved ever since.\u201d Competing in a number of other hackathons since 2018, including Same Home Different Hacks, ICON Hyperhack, and DevRev, Gedion has paved his way through the hacker community. In addition to competing, Gedion has gone on to act as a mentor and a judge at other hackathons,\u00a0become a GitHub Campus Expert, and has even helped organize a hackathon with Def Hacks.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Gedion says he had the opportunity to \u201cread, learn, and practice anything and everything.\u201d During the first year of the pandemic, Gedion dedicated his time to learning new stacks, taking on difficult data science and cybersecurity courses, and sourcing partnership leads for a tech startup. However, Gedion felt he needed direction to narrow his focus as a programmer to more specific skill sets. He joined the MLH Fellowship in the summer of 2021 and continued to develop his programming skills with a little more guidance. In that time, he also developed a passion for teaching others and began hosting workshops. Gedion says the \u201cexperience\u2026itself helped me to stand out from the talent pool.\u201d Within months of completing the Fellowship, Gedion was being recognized by large tech companies and has since worked as a senior full stack developer and a technical trainer.\n\nFor nearly a year, Gedion has also worked as an Admissions Specialist with Major League Hacking, interviewing and helping to select the best candidates out of the thousands of applications. Gedion says he became an Admissions Specialist because of how highly he regarded the Fellowship. Opportunities like the MLH Fellowship are not exactly common in Addis Ababa, and Gedion is happy to be able to give back to the hacker community. In his role as admissions specialist, Gedion says he appreciates giving other \u201ctalented people out there the same experience I was able to gain from the Fellowship.\u201d Gedion plans to stay involved in the hacker community after he graduates from his university and says his experience as a hacker has left him feeling \u201cprepared, confident, and ready\u201d for his professional career after college.",

When he was in middle school, he spent his time playing guitar and producing music. In his spare time, he simplified and taught physics concepts to an audience of around 3,000 with his Instagram. While he didn\u2019t discover coding until high school, and was unable to major in CS in college, Aziz has worked hard teaching himself the ins and outs of coding, dedicating countless hours of his time to learning everything from Java and Python to web development. Aziz says, \u201cI believe my story shows that there are no limitations on what one can do and achieve.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, finding the hacker community wasn\u2019t easy initially. Several months after coming to the United States as part of his college program at Duke University, Aziz made a trip to Tennessee to meet some of his friends from high school. They happened to be involved in the organizing team for VandyHacks and encouraged Aziz to apply. Aziz admits he felt impostor syndrome when first applying, but he made friends as soon as he joined the Discord, quickly being invited to a team by another hacker who felt Aziz was a perfect fit. The experience, he says, changed his life. Aziz later competed in MakeUC with the same team to create Recaipe, an app designed to assist people with food allergies and dietary restrictions. Aziz says the project they completed \u201cenergized me and sparked my long-dormant passion for creating.\u201d\n\nAziz believes he has been greatly influenced by the hacker community and says hackathons \u201chave empowered me with the knowledge and helped me to find what is truly my passion.\u201d Through the community, Aziz has grown his skill set as a programmer tremendously. In addition to Recaipe, Aziz has worked on projects to help educators assess student engagement and to help healthcare workers from developing countries predict a patient\u2019s condition. He also developed Crossroadss to help students within Duke University to find others they can collaborate with on projects. He\u2019s already gotten several sign ups and hopes his platform will help dozens of hackers come together and create over the next year.\n\nTo Aziz, one of the biggest benefits of hackathons is the ability to collaborate with people from all over the world with completely different skill sets. In his time in the community, Aziz has \u201chad the privilege to create with hackers from India, South Korea, the United States, Canada, and Taiwan,\u201d adding \u201cour differences turned out to be our strengths instead of weakness. We were able to complement each other and built incredible things together.\u201d He has been an excellent role model for his community in Uzbekistan, and he has been inspired to organize his own hackathon to share the opportunity with other students like him. \u201cBecause very few students from my school attended\u2026hackathons, I thought they were missing out [on] a lot of opportunities hackathons have to offer in terms of personal growth and career,\u201d Aziz says. Today, Aziz is a testament to the positive experience of hackathons, because, despite not majoring in computer science, he\u2019s already earned two campus jobs in tech and this is only the beginning.",

    "about": "After joining the Bishop Ireton High School Coding Club in 2015, on advice from Major League Hacking (MLH) Coach Peter Murphy, Patrick Riley competed in the club\u2019s small-scale hackathon that winter. He has now been actively involved in the hacker community for seven years. Discovering a passion for technology early in childhood, he enjoyed tinkering with his family computer and learning about how software programs work. Patrick says \u201ctechnology has given me not only a career, but also an avenue to give back to my community in an area that is desperately needed today. I hope to continue to learn and give back throughout the rest of my college career and for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nUsing languages like Lua, Python, and JavaScript to create a mobile game at that first hackathon was \u201can awesome experience,\u201d Patrick says, \u201cand it was so cool to see what I was able to create in just twelve short hours.\u201d Wanting to attend a larger scale hackathon, Patrick and a few friends registered for HackTJ. While the simple game his team built didn\u2019t win, Patrick \u201cwas able to see how impactful hackathons could be at bringing computer science to students of all backgrounds.\u201d Inspired to host a hackathon at his own high school, Patrick teamed up with friends to organize HackBI, Bishop Ireton\u2019s first-ever hackathon.\n\nThe process of organizing a hackathon gave Patrick the opportunity to work with sponsors, plan workshops, handle logistical issues, and coordinate judging for the hackathon. Patrick believes \u201cseeing the hackathon experience from both sides confirmed just how beneficial hackathons are to everyone involved,\u201d and says the experience led him to become even more involved with the hacker community. Through these early organizing experiences, Patrick was prepared to face the challenge of stewarding VTHacks through the COVID-19 pandemic, transitioning the event from in-person to a virtual format and back again.\n\nThe hacker community has had a massive influence on Patrick\u2019s professional career. \u201cMy current job as a software engineer is directly due to my involvement in HackBI, and my recent admission to graduate school is also reflective of my work with VTHacks,\u201d Patrick says. Always wanting to share the hackathon experience with others, he looked for ways to help his events grow in attendance and scope. When he organized HackBI, Patrick was able to help increase attendance by 160%, and secure increased funding from companies and school administrators. At VTHacks, Patrick continued to grow the reach of hackathons, this time in more directed ways.\n\nInspired by Virginia Tech\u2019s mission of Ut Prosim (that I may serve) and events like HackViolet, Patrick decided to focus much of the outreach for VTHacks on first-time hackers and non-CS students, demographics Patrick says are \u201coften neglected when reaching out to communities for hackathons.\u201d Working directly with other student organizations, as well as academic advisors for both STEM and non-STEM majors, Patrick intends to make the hackathon experience an even more inclusive one.\n\nFor all this, Patrick says, \u201cI have been helping [to] organize hackathons for nearly a third of my life, and have helped provide over a thousand students with a hackathon experience that I hope impacted them as much as it has me.\u201d",

    "about": "When she was young, Reeva Khokhar always enjoyed working on puzzles. Her desire to solve problems led her to computer science and coding, and she continues to use her technical capabilities to find solutions to issues large and small. Her impact on the hacking world is substantial, as is her commitment to the community.\n\nReeva got an early start in technology. In 6th grade, she attended an Introduction to Python, Graphics, and Animation workshop , and the results floored her. She says, \u201cI simply could not believe that I was able to tell the computer what to do, and that is where my whole programming journey started.\u201d From that point, she dove into learning new languages and gaining programming expertise.\n\nShe soon fell into web design and development, which let her combine her coding skill set with her creative and artistic talents. By 8th grade, she could already build complete web apps, incorporating front-end technology like HTML, CSS, and JS with back-end such as Python and SQL.\n\nHer first hackathon, FutureHacks 2021, provided her the perfect chance to showcase and develop her talents. Going back to her puzzle-solving days, she thought of an issue that needed a solution: her grandmother had trouble reading the tiny print on medicine bottles. Reeva wanted to fix that. This decision showcased more than her tech abilities; it also demonstrated her compassion and desire to find solutions for others. She worked virtually with a partner in Indonesia, navigating a twelve hour time difference! The puzzle pieces started coming together, and the two figured out how to make it work, using machine learning and AI to create a functional app and winning Best Overall at the hackathon.\n\nHer success at hackathons continued (she went on a 15-win streak in the summer of 2021), and so did her social and emotional growth. She turned from introvert to extrovert, learning to communicate more confidently. She says, \u201cPresentations were my biggest fear. However, there was something about the hackathon and the presentation that made the words flow right out of me [...] in this hackathon, I was also able to overcome my fear of presentations.\u201d She learned how to work collaboratively with community members around the globe, and gained inspiration in everything she does\u2014all while still in high school.\n\nShe progressed in hackathons, challenging herself to do more. She entered the Yale CBIT hackathon, which included graduate students and PhDs, and she won the Audience Choice award. Her pitch was an app to prevent adverse drug reactions using machine learning, neural networks, data parsing, and several health APIs. This success sparked her next move: turning this app into a startup\u2014MedLog. She says, \u201cI began to realize that my true passion is actually in the intersection of technology and business.\u201dShe landed an internship and full scholarship from iStartValley, where she is developing MedLog. These successes increased her confidence even further, and her future in coding and pursuing the business aspects of tech look bright.\n\nGiving back to the community that has done so much for her and finding solutions to support others have motivated Reeva. Her younger brother has special needs, so she developed an app called S.P.E.D. at Hydrangea Hacks to help students like him learn programming during the pandemic. She still devotes an hour and a half each week to teaching coding to special education students.\n\nShe also is very aware of the gender disparity in tech. She developed leadership skills during Major League Hacking (MLH) hackathons and used them to spearhead women empowerment initiatives in technology. She is a founding member of the Girls Who Code chapter at her high school, serves on the National Teen Advisory Board of Techgirlz, is starting a women-in-STEM podcast called TechBytes, and is organizing hackathons focused on women and non-binary participants like Superposition VI 2022.\n\nTo Reeva, puzzles have always been exciting and rewarding. She\u2019s found new joy in solving social issues and tackling problems that those in her community face, starting with something as small as the fine print on Grandma\u2019s medicine bottle.",

    "about": "Anita Yip and technology were always a perfect fit\u2014she just didn\u2019t realize it until college. Growing up in government-assisted housing for low-income families, she didn\u2019t have access to much technology, including a mobile phone, until she became a young adult. Since she discovered her inner talents, she has participated and excelled in multiple hackathons and has helped the hacker community tremendously. She feels her openness, big-picture thinking, and drive to find solutions have been ideal for her success in the hacker community.\n\nEarly in her college career, she aimed to make a positive influence, including pioneering a community bike program on campus and raising money for need-based financial aid,\u00a0 which she had received herself.\n\nIn the winter of 2018, Anita attended her first hackathon: SheHacks Boston, the event that later became the organization TechTogether. The experience rekindled her interest in coding. She began attending hackathons in person in late 2019, and she immediately saw the value of networking and how MLH events bring creative minds together. By the summer of 2020, she was in full hackathon mode, beginning with MLH\u2019s Hackcation, where she says, \u201cI started seeing hackathons as a way to set aside time to learn.\u201d\n\nThrough MLH events, Anita expanded her knowledge of new technologies. At TecHacks 2020, she completed her first solo project, Project Max Match, which won her second place in the event.\n\nShe grew and blossomed from that point on, bonding with fellow hackers, often forming teams with people she meets at the event, learning new technologies, and developing the next chapter in her journey: mentoring and giving back to the community. She strives to help those underrepresented in tech. After almost 100 hackathons, she has made an impact on the MLH community by providing guidance and support to many new hackers.\n\nHackathons have given Anita more than just technical knowledge and computer skills. She has gained what she calls significant \u201csocial capital,\u201d bonding with a vast, diverse group of like-minded individuals. As she says, \u201cThanks to hackathons, I\u2019ve met a number of people who I feel at home with because they simply \u2018get\u2019 me.\u201d\n\nBeing the first in her family to graduate from college, Anita faced unique challenges, including charting her own course academically and in her career. Still, she has channeled those obstacles into proven success. After spending many years building capacity at and fundraising for various nonprofit organizations, she saw how tech could transform nonprofits and sought to work at the intersection of technology and social impact. While she always had the desire and ability to succeed, hackathons helped cast away numerous doubts and fears.\n\nWith each hackathon win, Anita became more curious, more daring\u2014 actively seeking to scratch that proverbial itch and experiment with new possibilities. Looking to push her own limits both personally and technically, she began taking more risks in her hacks, exploring\u00a0 technologies like the Nest API, Unity, DataStax Astra, and Jina, to name a few. While she says creating winning hacks is satisfying, her true satisfaction comes from trying new things and experimenting. She feels this too contributes to her formula for success: as she works on projects, she\u2019s open to new ideas, new technologies, and new roles on each team.\n\nSince entering the world of hackathons, she\u2019s fine-tuned her career aspirations, pivoting from aiming to be a software engineer to her new goal of being a technical product or project manager. She sees the path in front of her becoming clearer thanks to MLH and her support network. She volunteers with Code for Boston, bringing her project management skills\u00a0 and technical knowledge to projects she is spearheading.\n\nOutside of tech, she runs, even completing the 2018 Boston Marathon in freezing rain as record numbers of competitors dropped out. You might think she loves to run, but actually, she says, \u201cI really don\u2019t. It\u2019s because I hate running that I\u2019m motivated to do it.\u201d With her sights set on being able to run half-marathons when she\u2019s 70+ years old, she has run 6 marathons since 2018. It\u2019s a testament to Anita\u2019s determination and drive that she challenges herself even with her hobbies.",

    "about": "Ayushi Sangoi\u2019s career so far has been nothing short of impressive. A current PhD candidate at the Vision and Neural Engineering Laboratory at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) in collaboration with Rutgers University\u2019s Health Science Campus, she has earned a dual degree in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Engineering, won several hackathons, and developed a reputation as a leader in her field, advocating for underrepresented groups in technology. She says her love for coding was sparked in high school, when she was selected for Karlie Kloss\u2019 ultra-competitive Kode With Klossy coding camp. Learning to code with Ruby, HTML, and CSS helped her see the promise of technology in the biomedical world, and she was able to merge both of her passions.\n\nBy her sophomore year of college at NJIT in 2017, Ayushi had decided to add a second major in Computer Engineering. Wanting to dive right into the world of technology, when she heard about HackNJIT from her friends, she immediately signed up. \u201cSince then, I have been hooked and have attended many more hackathons,\u201d Ayushi says. At first, she was skeptical that she would fit in as an engineer with more experience in MATLAB than in Python\u2014today, she has attended over 40 hackathons.\n\nAt Hack(H)er413, Ayushi secured her first hackathon win with a MATLAB project. She now enjoys using languages that are more popular with engineers than hackers, ensuring that her projects stand out. To Ayushi, \u201cseeing the diversity of projects, especially hardware hacks,\u201d is what inspired her to begin submitting her own projects at hackathons in the first place. She still fondly remembers being impressed by a pinball game made of pizza boxes. Her first hackathon project was a hardware hack, a boat she aptly named Frankenstein which would run based on the contractions of an Arduino-driven electrically stimulated frog leg.\n\nWhen Ayushi first started competing at hackathons, she specifically submitted hardware hacks because she felt her coding skills were not up-to-par with her predominantly male classmates. However, with more experience, she has \u201ccome to appreciate hackers in all walks of life and experience.\u201d Her latest win at HackNJIT involved hardware integrated with a primarily software project designed to help universities and domestic violence centers.\n\nToday, Ayushi is doing her part to make an impact and make the hacker community even more inclusive. Recently, she was selected to be a campus facilitator for Kode with Klossy. As part of her role, she recruits women and gender non-conforming students to code in HTML and CSS. Focusing her efforts in her local area of Newark, New Jersey, she was able to recruit 12 students for her first workshop. Along with her co-facilitator, Ayushi has focused on empowering women in technology and encouraged their students to attend female-centric hackathons. \u201cI believe recruiting girls and showing them early the importance of coding and the purpose of hackathons are some of my biggest impacts on the hacker community,\u201d Ayushi says.",
