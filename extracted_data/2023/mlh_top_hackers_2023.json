    "about": "When Angela was in her sophomore year, she had no idea what she wanted to study in college. She tested the waters in different fields, but what stood out to her the most was her Intro to Computer Science course. Although her first programs were for basic calculations, like one which found the greatest common denominator between two numbers, Angela quickly realized that computer programs could be used to solve a whole host of problems. What appealed to Angela about a career in technology were the countless opportunities to learn new things and pivot to new projects. She says, \u201ctechnology unlocked purpose and motivation for me\u2014there is always something new to learn.\u201d\n\nDuring her junior year, when the COVID-19 pandemic swept the globe, Angela dedicated herself to learning coding online. Motivated by having something tangible to show for her efforts, she developed applications related to her own interests. Angela watched countless videos and read numerous articles, but struggled to stay motivated in her pursuit. When she attended her first hackathon, MasseyHacks VI, she discovered a new source of motivation. The format of hackathons made learning easier and gave her the direction she needed to advance her career.\n\nAngela was one of two girls in her high school computer engineering class in Ottawa, and constantly felt underestimated by her peers due to her gender. As a result, Angela is passionate about increasing accessibility in tech. She joined Project Tech Careers (PTC) in 2020 and is currently PTC\u2019s Chief People Officer. With PTC, she organized monthly events for middle and high school students, developing curriculum for everything from basic coding literacy to professional career development.\n\nAngela strives to serve underrepresented communities and has helped drive engagement among female-identifying students.\u201cThere is a lack of representation in the technology field,\u201d Angela says, adding, \u201cI believe proper representation and a strong support system are critical to nurturing and encouraging anyone to take risks and pursue learning, regardless of the area.\u201d In 2020, Angela competed in the Technovation Challenge, a global community for girls in tech. The mission resonated with her, and she subsequently joined as a student ambassador, hosting workshops, inviting students, and building an environment where aspiring hackers felt empowered to tackle real-world issues.\n\nAngela has participated in numerous hackathons herself, most recently speaking at Hack the North, Canada\u2019s largest hackathon, and hacking at ConUHacks VII. Through Major League Hacking, Angela was introduced to ETHGlobal. Angela\u2019s team competed at ETHToronto and placed in the top 5, which eventually led to earning a full scholarship to attend ETHLisbon and world-renowned tech conference Web Summit in Portugal. Through her first hackathon, Angela was introduced to Shopify and later admitted to their selective Dev Degree program. She currently interns as a security engineer at Shopify while earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science from Carleton University.",

Her first hackathon changed her entire trajectory. HackUTD VIII was the first event she attended. She was unsure of what to expect at first, but after winning first place for a sponsor challenge, she said, \u201ceven though I felt like we built something basic and could have done more, I was very proud of our accomplishment. Winning was the start of it all.\u201d\n\nThat hackathon kicked off a flurry of events as Trinh made it her goal to enter as many as possible. Soon, she discovered\u2014and grew to love\u2014the community that goes along with hackathons. As she remembers, \u201cWe were like a traveling band going around on a hackathon tour and encouraged as many people as we could to partake in our weekly road trips around Texas. Not only did I learn so much from my new friends and teammates, I felt like I was part of the hacker community.\u201d Trinh sees the people she meets at hackathons as her reason to continue learning and evolving as a coder.\n\nHackathons did more than just solidify her coding skills, though. They let her open up as a person and come out of her shell. At hackathons, she met like-minded people with similar interests working together towards a common goal, creating tangible projects with real-world applications. At 2023 HackTAMU, Trinh gathered an unlikely group of newcomers and led them to create a valuable and dynamic project. Trinh remembers teaching a teammate React Native and Expo while also designing the pages of the application. Working together as a team, they were able to bring together a finished project and even win the Best Use of MatLab prize!\n\nTrinh Le began coding later in her student career, but that hasn\u2019t slowed her down. Ever since she discovered her love for technology and hackathons, she has been on a mission to share her knowledge with others. Her constant commitment to newcomers in the hacker community has made hackathons more accessible. She dedicates as much time to looking for opportunities to help others as she does to discovering new boba tea shops.\n\nShe says about her entry into the world of hacking: \u201cI was only a beginner but the possibilities were infinite.\u201d Though she\u2019s already accomplished a lot, those infinite possibilities are still ahead of her.",

    "about": "Chukwuemeka Mba knows the importance of teamwork. Personal ambition and achievement are components of success, but support is crucial. He attributes his ascent through the hackathon world to his network of friends for inspiring him and helping him reach his goals.\n\nChukwuemeka is originally from Lagos, Nigeria, but currently lives in Boston. These cities may seem like worlds apart, but one thing has bridged the two: technology. Growing up, a friend with experience in Blockchain convinced Chukwuemeka to get into programming as a path to a bright future. He jumped into Python, and over the next several months created his first web application using Python Django. HTML and CSS were his next stepping stones, and before he knew it, he was developing multiple applications.\n\nTeamwork and networking have been continual allies for Chukwuemeka. As he developed his programming skill set, a friend introduced him to Major League Hacking (MLH), and that experience launched his hacking career. His first hackathon was BC Hacks 2022, where he fell in love with the hackathon environment and how attendees could raise each other up all the way to victory. He says, \u201cI lost a handful of them early on, which was quite discouraging until I won my first. That was when I understood the value of teams.\u201d\n\nIn the time since BC Hacks, Chukwuemeka has accomplished so much. He went from a hackathon attendee and open source contributor to a Fellow in the MLH Fellowship. His progression into coaching and mentoring has benefitted many hackers looking for guidance, and the feeling is mutual. As he says, \u201cThe hacker community in its entirety has introduced me to wonderful personalities and strengthened my knowledge of the fact that I am not alone. There are many more hackers here that are as enthusiastic about learning and giving back as I am.\u201d\n\nWhile the community has been instrumental to his success, Chukwuemeka can also thank his personal drive and perseverance for getting him where he is today. His dedication to coding, from teaching himself multiple programming languages to immersing himself in hackathons, has opened new doors for him. He says, \u201cI went from selling groceries at a local store in Boston to winning multiple hackathons. It just goes to show what is possible with a vision.\u201d\n\nThis determination can be seen in his approach to the MLH Fellowship. He applied for the MLH Fellowship Prep Program early in his hackathon career and was denied, but he did not give up. He bolstered his hacking resume and re-applied twice, and was finally accepted into the MLH Fellowship program. He does not take for granted the dedication and resilience he showed, and knows that giving back to the MLH community is the greatest gift he can offer in return.\n\nChukwuemeka is a prime example of harnessing the power of collaboration, but maintaining an exceptional work ethic to carry you to your dreams. Whether he is learning a new programming language or bouncing ideas off of other hackers, he is constantly moving forward and looking for the next challenge. As he states, \u201cTechnology as a whole has changed my outlook on life to one of transcendental optimism.\u201d With that attitude, Chukwuemeka\u2019s future looks bright.",

When he moved to the United States, he knew of four career options: doctor, banker, lawyer, and failure. None of them interested him. He moved aimlessly from class to class, unsure of the right major, until the fateful day he discovered hackathons.\n\nHis first hackathon was intimidating at first. He had no computer science experience and only attended based on the promise of giveaways and free food. However, the buzzing environment of HopHacks 2019 awakened a sudden excitement within him. He says, \u201cThe hackathon I attended was a turning point in my life. I was amazed by the creativity, problem-solving, and collaborative environment that was so unique to the hacker community.\u201d Hackathons ignited his passion for programming. \u201cNow I know that there are more options than what I was initially told,\u201d he said. \u201cSoftware engineering is the path that I would like to pursue.\u201d\n\nDuring the pandemic, Chinat leveraged his newfound spare time by pivoting to pursue a computer science degree. He says, \"Computer Science was the only major where classes were the same both offline and online, behind a screen. I had the space to figure out what I wanted to do in college and catch up with my peers.\" Throughout this career change, he worked with mentors who changed his life, opening his eyes to the importance of mentorship and community support. For example, Aaron Osher, his mentor at the YCP Hackathon, introduced Chinat to the T3 Stack and changed his outlook on what technology is truly capable of achieving.\n\nIt is this spirit of mentorship that Chinat appreciates the most about Major League Hacking, and more broadly, the hackathon community. Many coders have their specific strengths, but having an entire network of accomplished individuals who are ready and willing to help others is what sets the hacker community apart.\n\nChinat\u2019s future had been predetermined and limited when he arrived at college, but computer science knocked down those walls. Coaching and mentoring were a natural progression and a way to return the favor. Chinat is the founding Vice President of the Johns Hopkins Software Engineering Club, where he organizes meetups and workshops for fellow hackers. He has served as a mentor to many, and was even invited to speak about hackathons to over 100 students at his university. He continues to share knowledge and experience through his podcast, Hopkins Hacks, and on his personal website. He built his website, which allows students to learn more about him by chatting with his AI digital twin, over the course of a hackathon. Chinat continues to attend monthly hackathons to hone his skills and stay involved with the community. He said, \u201cI have attended and won 4 hackathons this year alone, and I would love to keep that streak up.\u201d\n\nChinat knows that illuminating new and unfamiliar ideas for others can be life-changing, as it was for him. He says, \u201cIt brings me great joy to see others get excited about technology and coding, and I\u2019m proud to be a part of the movement that\u2019s driving innovation and change in the world.\u201d The best news is that the community at large gets to take part in that joy and gain inspiration from the great things Chinat is accomplishing. Having discovered the power of mentorship, community, and technology through hackathons, Chinat will combine these passions through the Masters in Learning, Design and Technology program at Stanford in Fall 2023. He says, \u201cI envision a future where learning is engaging, accessible, and personalized, leveraging the power of technology and community to transform education into a personal journey that enriches every student's life and amplifies their potential.\u201d",

Her first coding experience came through a mentorship program with More Active Girls In Computing (MAGIC), where she was matched with a female mentor in the tech field. Learning Python from her mentor, getting to tour Google\u2019s headquarters, and creating her first project inspired her to learn everything she could about programming. When she got to high school, she signed up for computer science and cybersecurity classes and spent her free time surfing YouTube for coding tutorials and taking online programming courses.\n\nMarina was nervous when she registered for her first hackathon, AdaHacks 2019, but says the event being inclusive for female and non-binary hackers made her feel welcome. Marina enjoyed the workshops at the hackathon even more than her classes at school, and felt encouraged to learn about technology in creative ways. She continued to develop her skills as a hacker through the Kode With Klossy program and Girls Who Code, where she completed courses in web design and development. In 2022, Marina earned the Gold Award, the most prestigious award offered by the Girl Scouts for her project PocketStory. PocketStory is an educational game app designed for children with disabilities.\n\nThe summer before her junior year of high school, Marina participated in the AI4ALL summer camp, where she discovered that less than half of American high schools offer computer science courses and less than 15% of current AI researchers are women. Inspired by her own experiences in the hacker community, Marina decided to found \u00a0Citro Tech, where she provides free tech education content and workshops to students around the world.\n\nWhen she decided to organize her own hackathon, Citro Hacks, Marina realized she had never actually led a team before. But after stumbling upon the Major League Hacking (MLH) community during the COVID-19 lockdowns, Marina found the tools she needed to organize a successful event. She says, \u201cwithout the community and other resources MLH provided, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to host a successful hackathon.\u201d Citro Hacks was a huge success, attracting 831 attendees from across the globe and raising over $3,000 in sponsorships. Marina says the most fulfilling part of hosting Citro Hacks was that 53% of the attendees were beginners and 99% of the attendees reported being more interested in careers in tech afterward. When one student personally messaged her on Discord thanking her for putting on the event, she was reminded that even though the hackathon was virtual, her impact had touched real people and made a difference.\n\nMarina continues to dedicate herself to encouraging new students to pursue careers in technology. She was actively involved in her high school\u2019s Society of Women Engineers club until graduation, helping to introduce middle school girls to engineering. Since starting classes at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Marina has served as a student intern and is now a board member of the Creative Tech Design club, where she has collaborated with others in designing and prototyping projects, creating case studies, and hosting workshops for other students. She remains passionate about equitable access to technology, and plans to pursue a career in software engineering or product design after graduation.",

Since high school, she has been coding constantly, pushing her own boundaries and providing opportunities to other members of her community. Rising from Major League Hacking (MLH) hackathon attendee to hackathon organizer, Cindy has brought her creative mindset and dedication to each of her roles.\n\nIn the summer before her junior year, Cindy joined Girls Who Code and instantly clicked with coding. A mentor there told her about hackathons and how they could expand her horizons. She jumped on the opportunity, joining Bytehacks NY, an all-women-identifying event in the fall of 2018. The whole experience inspired her. She and her team stayed up late and woke up early to finish their HTML/CSS website. She says, \u201cWe would show off our Twitter API (the coolest thing ever for some 16-year-olds to figure out) and ultimately won an MLH prize for the best domain name (Grief Relief). It was amazing to feel like we accomplished something and didn\u2019t go home empty-handed.\u201d The energy and potential to create and grow was addictive to Cindy, and she\u2019s never looked back.\n\nElectrified by her first hackathon, she signed up for TechTogether Boston in her senior year, which she calls \u201ca life-changing experience.\u201d She and her team attended workshops, developed a fantastic project, and fully immersed themselves in the community.\n\nDuring her time as a student at New York University, Cindy\u2019s participation in hackathons led her to organizing her own. She strived to recreate the amazing experiences she had at hackathons for others. Whether fundraising, advertising, or directing, she has given back to the hacker community in myriad ways. Some of her achievements include serving as marketing director for TechTogether New York Fall 2021, sponsorship director for HackNYU Spring 2022, co-executive director for HackNYU in the spring of 2023, and planner for MLH Pizza Fund events from 2022-2023. Much of Cindy\u2019s appreciation for hacking comes from how much she enjoys community events. For example, at Hackcon 2022, she bonded with other organizers while eating s\u2019mores, sitting around a campfire, sleeping in a cabin, and eating her first cronut.\n\nHackNYU 2022, one of the events she helped organize, brought in over 800 participants and created a buzz throughout the hacker community. Many participating hackers were featured in their local newspapers and media outlets for carrying the torch of tech\u2019s future. Cindy saw how inspiring hackathons can be and how many people they can affect. Though Cindy\u2019s focus has shifted away from computer science\u2014she majored in Cinema Studies and now works in Marketing and HR\u2014her dedication to the hackathon experience has stayed strong.\n\nCindy Mata is an excellent example of how hackathons can draw people into a new community. She loved attending hackathons so much that she went on to organize them and link others to resources even as her career interests changed. Her passion and drive have paid off, not just for herself, but also for those lucky enough to attend her events.",

After competing in the financial inclusion-centered hackathon Kiva Fall 2021, Matt went on to win Best Use of Conversational AI and 2nd place Overall at Treasure Hacks 3.0 for his work on JourneyGenie, an AI travel assistant which leveraged OpenAI\u2019s existing large language model through API calls. Matt recently participated in ETHToronto, and will be joining hackNY to continue honing his programming and hacking skills this summer.\n\nPerhaps Matt\u2019s most impressive accomplishment to date has been founding his own startup, Agora Labs, a social token and NFT infrastructure platform. When Matt raised close to $20,000 for $MATT, his first social token using DeSo Protocol, he kept himself accountable to token-holders through regular check-ins. His dedication to continuous progress meant he was always growing, and his friends and family saw Matt\u2019s social token as a way to invest in his promising career. With the social token space booming amongst creators, Agora was one of the first platforms to make it easy for creators to connect their DeSo tokens and choose specific rewards and perks for their supporters.\n\nMatt continued to kickstart his career through Envision Accelerator and the RippleX Fellowship, scaling his knowledge of cryptocurrency at events organized by Kernel and the Crypto Society, and growing his web3 development skills through Developer DAO and Safary. Matt was admitted to the ultra-competitive Z Fellows startup fellowship,which includes mentorship from world-renowned founders of companies like Netflix, Eventbrite, DoorDash, and Tinder. Within weeks of Matt\u2019s fellowship, Agora had secured over $100,000 in blockchain grants from DeSo, Harmony, and others, and reached a market cap of over $500,000 in under 72 hours on DeSo. In October of 2022, his startup was acquired by Talent Protocol and he joined the Talent Protocol team along with his co-founder, Freeman Zhang.\n\nMatt says, \u201cthe people are EVERYTHING in the hacker community.\u201d Since Agora\u2019s acquisition, Matt has worked to help others find success in their careers in tech. He has dedicated himself to helping other hackers scale and sell their side projects, and was also a founding partner of Inner Circle, the largest invite-only tech group in Canada. Over the last year, Matt has hosted 3 events with more than 800 attendees as part of Inner Circle. In 2023, Matt completed the Major League Hacking (MLH) Fellowship, where he gained valuable experience as a hacker and developed his skill set through working with MapRoulette. Matt continues to assist others in their journeys through his newsletter, The Compound Advantage.",

    "about": "Some individuals stand out as natural leaders, and Olsen Budanur is one of them. With an exceptional work ethic, he\u2019s gone above and beyond to create new opportunities for the hacker community and bring others into the world of tech.\n\nOlsen was a digital child growing up in the DC Metro Area. He loved video games and computers as a kid, but his love for tech really took off in middle school. Using VisualBasic\u2019s GUI-based desktop app, he was able to create simple apps that got him excited for more challenging projects. His coding adventures took off in high school, and he credits Major League Hacking (MLH) hackathons with truly igniting his passion for code.\n\nOlsen\u2019s first hackathon was VTHacks 7 in 2019. It was after this hackathon that his future became crystal clear. He says, \u201cI discovered that I have a passion for coding and building things, and I enjoyed the challenge of coming up with innovative solutions to problems. After the hackathon, I continued to attend various events and meetups within the hacker community.\u201d\n\nSince that first hackathon, he has attended seven more MLH Member hackathons. The enjoyment of building and coding things from scratch has kept his fire burning brightly, and he still thrives in the competitive environment hackathons offer. Through hackathons, he also discovered a side of hacking that he did not realize existed before: community. He says, \u201cBeing surrounded by like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology has been incredibly inspiring, and I have made lifelong connections as a result.\u201d\n\nOlsen soon saw his potential as an organizer and a leader.

Before being accepted to a bachelor\u2019s program in computer science at the University of Minnesota, Samyok had no formal computer science education. When he started learning coding online during his junior year of high school, Samyok discovered he could use his curiosity and drive to create things that made a difference in the world. \u201cI was hooked,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Samyok didn\u2019t start developing software until his junior year, his talents still had an outsized impact on his high school community before graduation. One of the first projects Samyok created was Bobcat Notify, an app that sent reliable emergency alerts to students, staff, and parents, which was downloaded over 2,000 times, more than double the number of students in the school!\n\nSeeking to develop his skills further, Samyok and his sister registered for their first hackathon, Sonoma Hacks. Not only did their project win, but Samyok was motivated by the environment of\u00a0 like-minded individuals who were all passionate about technology. During his gap year between high school and college, Samyok became an active member of the hacker community, and has since competed in more than 20 hackathons. He has submitted winning projects at several hackathons, including HackMIT, HackNYU, TAMUhack,and HackUIowa, as well as hackathons centered on social good like Hacking 4 Community and Santa Clara University\u2019s Hack for Humanity. In addition to developing his technical skills, Samyok credits hackathons with enabling him to build a network of like-minded individuals who he can turn to for support and mentorship.\n\nSamyok says he is not sure he would ever have left his hometown if he hadn\u2019t been exposed to the hacker community. He believes hackathons and his career in computer science have given him the ability to climb the socioeconomic ladder. In addition, Samyok says, \u201cbeing part of the hacker community has given me a sense of belonging.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecognizing my privilege and the opportunities that have been afforded to me,\u201d Samyok says, \u201cI have made it my mission to help others in the hacking community.\u201d At HackUIowa and HackNYU, Samyok helped his team of inexperienced hackers win first place, and says they have all since found their own footing in the tech industry. At the University of Minnesota, Samyok has worked hard to drive hackathon engagement among students\u2014this year alone, his university is sending 16 students to LA Hacks. Samyok is also organizing the University of Minnesota\u2019s first novice hackathon, which will take place this academic year.\n\nThrough his work with Social Coding at the University of Minnesota, Samyok led a team in building Gopher Grades, which allows students to view unbiased grade distributions and class ratings when building class schedules. It has been used by more than 30,000 students to conduct more than two million searches. In his role as lead, Samyok has brought eight freshmen onto the team this semester, guiding them through web development. He is also heavily involved with Code the Gap, where he volunteers as a mentor, teaching coding to between 15 and 20 underprivileged middle school and high school students. During his gap year, Samyok founded the Dakota Debate Institute, a non-profit dedicated to expanding accessibility in high school speech and debate. With each new organization he creates or partners with, Samyok strengthens his impact on individuals and the hacker community as a whole.",

    "about": "Mareline Ramirez had always thought she would pursue a career in healthcare, electing for a major in Health and Human Concerns at Florida International University and even working as a medical assistant for several months. She was also heavily involved in her campus community as the Vice President for APPA at FIU, FIU\u2019s pre-physician assistants organization. During the peak of COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, Mareline learned coding basics and created the club\u2019s website to better communicate and share resources with members virtually. Her efforts attracted 300+ additional club members. Mareline loved the experience of learning to code, and felt fulfilled creating something which had an immediate and tangible impact on others.\n\nWhen Mareline graduated from FIU she still had a passion for coding, but was unsure how to put it to use. Initially, she was nervous to pursue a career in technology. Women are still underrepresented in Miami\u2019s tech industry and face gaps in access and resources. Not to mention that most of Mareline\u2019s network was based in healthcare. Luckily, she had a few friends who studied computer science, and they encouraged her to build on her passion for coding. Just a few months later, Mareline began a second degree at FIU in computer science.\n\nSwitching to a career in tech after so much time in healthcare wasn\u2019t always easy. Mareline enrolled in the Microsoft Tech Resilience mentorship program shortly after deciding to study computer science, but felt timid and out of place in her male-dominated classes. However, she found excellent mentors at Reboot Representation, and credits her friend Danay Fernandez (president of FIU Women in Cybersecurity) for providing her with the resources she needed to get started in computer science. Through Danay, Mareline was introduced to TechTogether, a series of hackathons focused on narrowing the gender gap in technology.\n\nWhile Mareline\u2019s first hackathon experience at CodeDay 2021 certainly helped to grow her skillset, she believes the experience of participating in TechTogether Chicago 2022 was pivotal in her career. Mareline says she immediately felt welcomed and resonated with TechTogether\u2019s mission of empowering marginalized genders in tech. Mareline has always been passionate about tackling gender inequality, so when she had the opportunity to follow Danay in leading TechTogether Miami as the Chapter Director, it seemed like the perfect fit.\n\nIn her role as Chapter Director, Mareline has been able to help bridge the gender gap in the Miami tech community and provide support to students coming from similar non-traditional backgrounds. She continues to provide support for other students, and has gotten involved in a number of other gender-focused events in the Miami-Dade area like Code/Art Fest 2022, FIU\u2019s Women in Tech Conference (WiTCON), HackaBull 2023, and Technica 2022. In addition to her role as Chapter Director for TechTogether Miami, Mareline stays actively involved in the hacking community through her university\u2019s chapters of Women in Computer Science, INIT, and Break Through Tech.",

A career educator who recently made the switch to a career in tech, Sarah has been able to leverage her impressive background in education to both share her knowledge with others and develop her skills as a programmer in her own right.\n\nFor someone who has always loved being a mentor, leaving a career in teaching was a difficult decision. Before Sarah decided to pursue a career in tech, she was working more than 60 hours a week, struggling to find time for her family and feeling the drag of perpetual burnout. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, teaching more than 100 students remotely, Sarah became interested in how the technologies she used to connect and educate students actually worked. She started using a mobile app to code on her 15-minute breaks between classes. Within three months, Sarah had been admitted to a Techtonica bootcamp, and she was able to translate that experience into an internship with Flickr beginning that fall.\n\nAfter a hiring freeze at Flickr prevented her from securing a full time position with the company, she learned about Major League Hacking (MLH). The CEO of her Techtonica bootcamp recommended she continue learning through the MLH Fellowship. Sarah initially felt intimidated about applying, knowing she would be up against career hackers. But Sarah thrives on the challenge of overcoming adversity, so she applied anyway. She was admitted for the Fall 2022 season, and participated in her first hackathon, the MLH Fellowship Orientation Hackathon, where she developed an even greater love of programming.\n\nSarah says the support from MLH Fellowship friends and fellow hackers has helped her learn and grow, while also allowing her to guide others. Sarah is grateful for the hackathon experience, which she says has helped her hone her programming skills while gaining exposure to completely new concepts. She has felt less stress, is able to better balance her work and life, and feels like she truly enjoys her new career in tech.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say Sarah is no longer practicing her skills as an educator. As a woman of color in a field where both women and people of color are underrepresented, Sarah understands the challenges many new hackers face in building a career in tech. Her experience as an educator, which totals more than a decade, makes her well-suited to mentor others and to understand their unique circumstances. She believes her ability to empathize with others makes her stand out within the hacker community. Sarah is passionate about diversity, equity, and inclusion, and focuses her efforts on increasing accessibility for hackers who have had non-traditional paths and lacked the resources to attend computer science programs. Recently, she was admitted to the Adobe Digital Academy, and has since secured an internship with Adobe starting this June. She plans to continue on to a career in full stack software engineering.",

Early on, Kari saw the potential of technology to impact issues that were deeply important to her, and says she does her best to \u201censure whatever I work on has that same effect, whether on myself or others.\u201d\n\nGraduating from high school during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic left Kari itching for interaction with her peers. She found the community she needed when one of her friends introduced her to her university\u2019s hackathon, VandyHacks. At the event, her team was matched with a local center for victims of sexual assault. The experience of collaborating with other hackers to create a project with a real-world impact inspired her desire to organize events like VandyHacks for her community.\n\nBy her second semester at Vanderbilt University, she had joined the VandyHacks organizing team as a Director, and has since served as President and Senior Marketing Advisor. Kari says, \u201cGetting to flourish into a leadership position as a freshman with the guidance of the experienced organizers around me taught me the power of mentorship and provided me with the community I really needed.\u201d The feedback they received after bringing VandyHacks back to an in-person format showed her just how important the hacker community was to fellow Vanderbilt students. VandyHacks is certainly in good hands, as Kari has helped select \u201cincredible organizers who share my passion for technology and drive to provide amazing opportunities for others.\u201d\n\nInspired by her experience organizing VandyHacks, Kari decided to become a Major League Hacking (MLH) Coach. In the role, she has grown as both an organizer and a hacker in her own right. Kari has since participated in WiCHacks, UA Innovate, and several VandyHacks events.

    "about": "Harshita first discovered coding when she was in high school in India. After finishing her first project, a simple website about herself which she created using HTML, Harshita was inspired to learn as much as she could about technology. Harshita says her love of programming stems from her love of the continuous process of effort, of trying and failing and trying again. But the process of trying and failing until you get it right is much more challenging in front of others, and for Harshita\u2014who saw herself as quiet and insecure in high school\u2014getting involved in the hacker community was a big decision.\n\nBy her sophomore year at the Birla Institute of Technology Mesra, Harshita was beginning to overcome her doubts, and decided to register for Hacking Heist as a solo participant. She enjoyed the experience enough to register for TechTogether New York the following month, where she submitted a winning project with her team. Through her early hackathon experiences and workshops at her school, Harshita slowly realized that her doubts about others judging her for not knowing things were misplaced, and that the hacker community was encouraging and welcoming.\n\nWhile Harshita initially liked to hack solo, support from peers and mentors at hackathons helped her find the courage to begin working with teams. Not only has she developed exceptional cooperative skills from participating in hackathons, but she says it has been a lot of fun just participating and meeting completely new people who turn out to be great friends.\n\nAs a first-generation tech student herself, Harshita knows how challenging it can be to build a career in tech without guidance. When she first applied for classes at the Birla Institute of Technology, she did not make it into the ultra-competitive computer science program, and instead enrolled in electronics and communication. But through her efforts she was eventually accepted\u00a0 into the computer science program. Her experiences sparked her passion for mentoring others and drove her to get involved with Go Girl Organisation, which focuses on empowering underserved communities through technology. Harshita says it is an amazing experience to teach young students and create presentations for them as part of Go Girl, and if any of them decide on a career in tech in the future, she will consider herself \u201csuccessful and accomplished.\u201d\n\nHarshita says she has \u201calways believed in giving back to society and making technology accessible for all.\u201d One of her favorite projects to date has been a browser extension for Google Chrome called Alexia, which aims to help people with dyslexia read text more easily. She has worked on a number of projects aimed at helping others, including a sign language interpretation platform she created using MATLAB at HackMerced VII.\n\nHarshita remains actively involved with Major League Hacking (MLH), Go Girl Organisation, Women Who Code, and Girls Who Code. She is also the open source lead for her university\u2019s chapter of Google Developer Student Clubs and the sponsorship coordinator for her school\u2019s technical committee. In 2022, she was awarded a Palantir Global Impact scholarship. She credits her family for her success, because they consistently encourage her to be the best she can be. She recently joined MLH as a Marketing Coordinator, and will continue to serve as a mentor for younger students blazing their own trails.",

With no formal computer science education growing up, she overcame the odds and is now an avid hacker.\n\nWhen she was a child, Indira loved tinkering with toys and machines. However, she faced obstacles that slowed her progress and made her feel the tech field was out of reach. As she says, \u201cMy high school never provided any classes to learn more about computer science topics, and I was discouraged by my peers from pursuing a career in such a male-dominated field, telling me I wasn\u2019t suited for it.\u201d Refusing to give up, Indira pursued online learning opportunities to teach herself programming. By the time college came along, she had the tools to succeed in computer science.\n\nHer first hackathon, Uberposition 2021, pulled her far out of her comfort zone. At the hackathon, she joined a group of strangers she met through the event\u2019s Discord server. Although her team did not win the event, the hackathon helped her overcome her lingering self-doubt and develop new tech skills.\n\nThis experience opened Indira up to a new future in hacking, and she has since entered multiple hackathons, improving her skill set and broadening her horizons in tech each time. In her third hackathon, cmd-f 2022, she won the MLH Most Creative Use of GitHub prize and the UBC Project Incubation Prize, earning her the opportunity to build new technologies through her university\u2019s Computer Science department. She also competed in Hack the 6ix 2022, placing as a Top 8 Finalist and getting to present her project in front of accomplished judges. Her project at Hack the 6ix won the MLH Most Creative Use of Twilio prize.\n\nHackathons helped her land her first internship as a Software Engineering Intern, as well as many more in the following summers, and landed her a spot in the Major League Hacking (MLH) Fellowship Prep program. Outside of hackathons, she is involved with Rewriting the Code, Girls Who Code, UBC Launchpad,\u00a0 and ElevateTech, and helps organize ElevateHacks and Juvenile Hacks.\n\nIndira\u2019s career at UBC has taken many turns. She struggled in many of her early hackathons to the point of nearly giving up, but the MLH community came through for her. She discovered a mentor who gave her the valuable advice to view hackathons as learning experiences, not just as events to win. Once Indira adopted that mindset, her hacking career took off and her potential was unleashed.\n\nThis change naturally pushed Indira into mentoring others. She understood the frustration of being the least experienced coder in the room. As she gained new skills, she turned towards coaching, especially for women-identified hackers going through what she did so recently. She says, \u201cNow, I am glad to give back to my community and offer guidance to those doubting their abilities to succeed in the field.\u201d\n\nIndira has demonstrated what a willing mind and strong determination can do. She is an example of what people are capable of achieving if they keep moving forward when others tell them to quit.",

    "about": "With such an accomplished hacking career, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking Jaival was much further along than the 11th grade. Inspired by Baymax, the heroic healthcare droid created by protagonist Tadashi Hamada in Disney\u2019s Big Hero 6, Jaival enrolled in a program with Exceed Robotics at age 8. Jaival says that his first experiences coding LEGO\u00ae MINDSTORMS\u00ae and building home automation systems with Arduino boards sparked an early passion for programming hardware. It wasn\u2019t until his friend introduced him to the Linux terminal that he discovered an interest in software engineering.\n\nAs a kid, Jaival was certain he wanted to become an astronaut. At night, he would dream about traversing the galaxies and research the steps to being hired by NASA. But upon realizing that the process involved strenuous physical tests and that only ten applicants out of more than 12,000 end up making the cut, Jaival pivoted to using his love of math and programming to further his dreams of exploring space. Jaival took more than forty courses in computer science and artificial intelligence by the time he finished middle school, and was recognized with his school\u2019s science award in the 8th grade for his work on a planet-detection neural network created using Python.\n\nIt was not immediately clear to Jaival how he would be able to use his love of math and programming to break into the space industry. With encouragement from his middle school community, however, Jaival was inspired to grow his skillset as a programmer even further by participating in hackathons. At his first hackathon, XdHacks Mini, Jaival says he was \u201ccompletely lost,\u201d and ended up missing the mark on the theme of medical hospitality, instead creating a project which optimized signals between Earth and orbiting telescopes. But the support from his peers at the hackathon and the interest his work attracted as the only space-related project encouraged Jaival to make the hackathon experience a staple of his burgeoning career.\n\nJaival\u2019s high school never had a formal hacking club, even with the student body\u2019s high interest in computer science during the pandemic, so Jaival and his friends took the initiative to create their own. Within a year, the club had attracted more than 400 students from across all grade levels. Jaival has also shared his knowledge with others every chance he\u2019s gotten, providing other students with weekly mentoring in algorithms and competitive programming, along with hosting events to inspire students to ship more projects they are interested in. Jaival has competed in more than thirty hackathons himself, including submitting winning projects at Hack the North and JAMHacks, and has also acted as a mentor at renowned hackathons like Hack the North and UofTHacks.\n\nJaival also strives to share his knowledge with others in his role as a core Computer Science and Mathematics Researcher for Medium\u2019s Towards Data Science, where he writes articles and creates relevant projects which touch an average of 300 readers a month. Jaival strongly believes \u201ceveryone should have the opportunity to live their lives to the fullest and have the resources to fulfill their purpose and dreams.\u201d Putting his goals into action, Jaival and his team at BubbleDAO were able to raise over $10,000 and host 85+ web3 hackathons and in-person events all last summer for new artists and developers to showcase their work. Jaival continues to volunteer as a teaching assistant with CommunityAI, helping young students develop a passion for technology.\u00a0 Jaival is the author of Beauty Of Mathematics, a book including mathematical proofs of fifteen pure-math theorems and an analysis of their applications to real-world industries. Recently, he worked with Ethereum developers on Radio, which took 2nd place at ETHNewYork and has attracted over 1,000 Web3 developers to date.",

    "about": "Samyuktha is the first to admit that technology wasn\u2019t always her passion. She initially pursued a biology major, but she slowly realized that her passion for biomedicine was more about the process of creating something with a real-world impact than about the field itself. Seeing how computer science would enable her to channel her spark for creating and problem-solving, Samyuktha began to teach herself coding and web development in her spare time. Before long, she secured a merit seat to pursue a Computer Science degree at PSG College of Technology in Coimbatore, India.\n\nA pivotal moment for Samyuktha was developing an Android app designed to serve patients seeking treatment for bipolar disorder. This project highlighted the profound impact of her technical skills. The app aimed to facilitate treatment by establishing a connection between doctors and patients. It enabled doctors to monitor pill intake, sleep patterns, and mood while scheduling necessary appointments. Notably, the app was part of a study, conducted by the Psychiatry department at PSG Hospitals in Coimbatore, assessing the effectiveness of smartphone applications in enhancing bipolar disorder treatment. Its significance was further magnified by its potential to aid patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, when quarantine and social distancing measures were in effect. Samyuktha successfully constructed the app after teaching herself to use technologies like Flutter and Firebase.\n\nAfter participating in aComputer Science & Engineering Association (CSEA) hackathon in 2018, Samyuktha became a hackathon regular.\u00a0 She deepened her involvement in the hacker community when she was accepted as a Microsoft Student Ambassador, seeking to grow her skills and network outside of class. From the start, Samyuktha wanted to create a community of like-minded tech enthusiasts at PSG. She hosted several events, speaking about Azure and Blockchain as well as introducing Microsoft Learn to more than 150 of her peers. Through the AWS Educate Cloud Ambassador Program Samyuktha was able to assist student-led startups and coordinate AWS Community Day India in 2020, which has since garnered over 28,000 views.\n\nSamyuktha says, \u201cin all my roles, I have been intentional about advancing diversity and equity in tech.\u201d After completing her bachelor\u2019s at PSG in 2021, Samyuktha was accepted to a master\u2019s program in computer science at Rutgers University, where she has served as the president of the Computer Science Graduate Student Society and as a Graduate Mentor with the Douglass Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) Program, helping guide undergraduate women through their Rutgers careers. In her role as a member of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Graduate Student Advisory Committee, she has worked to further DEI initiatives at the university.\n\nOutside of Rutgers, she has worked as a mentor for Our Future Is Science, helping three high school students make a difference through social justice and science.

    "about": "Celina never planned on pursuing a career in tech. Her senior year of high school, she was dead set on moving to the US to study psychology. However, recognizing the high cost of studying abroad, she made the spontaneous decision to stay in Poland and enroll in a Bachelor of Engineering program in computer science at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology (PJAIT).\n\nCelina was always independent, believing she could solve any problem by herself. But she also dealt with nagging doubts about her abilities as a programmer. \u201cI would feel embarrassed to reach out to others for help,\u201d she said, and found herself constantly asking: \u201cWhat if people think I\u2019m not good enough?\u201d\n\nWhen Celina found the Major League Hacking (MLH) community through the MLH Fellowship in the summer of 2022, she had already been studying computer science for 2 years. But it was through the hacker community, and not her classes, that she began to overcome her self-doubt and blossom into the successful hacker she is today. The community she joined during the MLH Fellowship showed her that asking questions was not a sign of weakness, but a marker of strength and a means to grow. Celina\u2019s first hacking experiences were overwhelmingly positive. She participated in the MLH Fellowship Orientation Hackathon and the Fall 2022 orientation hackathon, where she was recognized for her work on Cody, an AI chatbot for computer science students.\n\nThrough hacking, Celina says, \u201cI have learned how to ask meaningful questions, how to communicate my problems, and how to feel confident in difficult situations.\u201d In addition to improving her technical skills, Celina believes the hacker community has been the biggest catalyst for her personal growth. Despite being more than two years into her hacking career by the time she found the MLH Fellowship, she considers it the most significant milestone of her career thus far. Inspired by mentors, pod leaders, and the new friends she met, she began to realize the importance of contributing to a team.\n\nWhat keeps Celina going are the possibilities computer science presents for solving real-world problems, which can make a visible and tangible impact on the community. She is using her knowledge as a hacker to create actionable change in her community. Currently, she is partnering with local hospitals in Warsaw to create a web-based system for confidential doctor-patient communication and secure medical data storage. While studying at PJAIT, she has also worked as an open source and software engineering intern with G-Research and is in the process of interviewing for her university\u2019s chapter of Google Developer Student Clubs. Every chance she gets, Celina is also working on raising climate change awareness and developing solutions using her technical knowledge.

    "about": "Rishab started coding with a desire to help people. At his first tech event in middle school, he and his team created an ASL textualization tool. Programming opened new doors and new opportunities for social good, but he says, \u201cEven though I loved computer science, I always thought of it as my passion and not something I wanted to study.\u201d At 17, when Rishab convinced his parents to let him travel across the world from his home in Bangalore, India to study at Boston University, he chose to enroll as a biology major.\n\nThat changed in Rishab\u2019s freshman year when he attended BostonHacks 2017 and was inspired by the upperclassmen around him, who hacked prototypes faster than he could come up with ideas. Motivated to learn everything he could about computers and become an expert hacker himself, Rishab competed in and submitted winning projects at HackNYU, HackHarvard, and WHACK 2018 over the following year. By the time Rishab was a sophomore, he had declared as a double major in Chemistry and CS and was a member of the team organizing BostonHacks.\n\nRishab is a skilled hackathon participant, but he doesn\u2019t stop there. He takes prototypes developed at hackathons and turns them into something more impactful. While attending PerkinsHacks, a hackathon organized by the Perkins School For The Blind geared towards solving real-world problems, Rishab saw the potential to help people with impaired vision navigate their surroundings. He was motivated to help people like his grandparents, who struggled with sight and mobility.\n\nIn collaboration with friends, he refined his idea at HackHarvard. They won Best Use of Google Cloud for their project Stepify, a piece of wearable hardware that could give audio feedback about a user\u2019s surroundings. Their project was noticed by Google for Education, and their team was put in contact with a group in Brazil to develop their idea as an app.\n\nOver the course of a year, Rishab and his friends collaborated to develop Eyespace, an accessibility tool for the visually impaired created through machine learning with Google Cloud and Google\u2019s Flutter toolkit. Eyespace users can communicate with a chatbot through voice or text input and receive spoken information describing their environment, including any obstacles in their path.\n\nBeyond just building Eyespace, Rishab also worked to make the software it used better. He obtained early access to the Flutter framework and made significant contributions to its source code.\n\nRishab has stayed deeply involved in the hacker community, mentoring at a number of hackathons. While mentoring at TechTogether, a series of hackathons by Major League Hacking aimed at combating gender inequality in tech, Rishab worked with a team creating smart locks for micromobility vehicles like electric bicycles and scooters. As the project progressed, Rishab transitioned from a mentorship role to a co-working role. That original project eventually grew into the company Rishab co-founded: Mount. To date, Mount has employed a team of 12, raised over $4M in seed funding, and been recognized by PhocusWire and the Colorado Cleantech Industries Association. Rishab continues to stay passionate about creating value for others, and hopes to inspire other first-generation students and international students to follow their dreams and find success.",

Victoria credits her AP Computer Science teacher and her instructors at Kode With Klossy for inspiring her to continue learning.\n\nThat fall, Victoria and friends from Kode With Klossy decided to sign up for their first hackathon, ByteHacks 2018, New York City\u2019s largest all-women hackathon. Victoria recalls having no idea how they would come up with a project idea and bring it to life in less than 24 hours, but feeling excited for the adventure. She pulled an all-nighter coding with her friends, somehow staying awake in the boggy New York humidity.

In addition to winning another award for Best Global Health Hack at Technica 2020, she worked as the chapter director for TechTogether Boston in 2021. She is also deeply involved in her campus community at Harvard, participating in the Harvard chapter of Women In Computer Science (WiCS). Through WiCS, Victoria has worked on the board of the Harvard Women Engineers Code Conference (WECode) as both a logistics director and a conference co-chair. Victoria is currently studying physics and astrophysics at Harvard, with a secondary concentration in computer science. Always balancing her passions, she also counts herself among the top 0.01% of Taylor Swift\u2019s Spotify fans.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, as it became clear virtual work would be the new norm, Victoria adapted. During this time, she says, \u201cI grew so much as a person when everything was virtual, and we all relied on technology to communicate. Because there were still limitations to how people could connect, I learned about the disparities among different people and communities in terms of access to technology.\u201d In the spring of 2021, Victoria returned to Kode With Klossy to work as a Facilitator for a pilot program in Nebraska aimed at reaching underrepresented school districts. She says it was meaningful for her to share her knowledge with students who had the same passions as she did but did not have access to the same resources.\n\nIn her role as a Harvard WECode Co-Chair, Victoria worked to make the event more accessible to all attendees. Not only did she expand the scholarship initiative, but she also helped form a partnership with Rewriting the Code to sponsor several students to attend for free or at reduced prices. The most recent version of the conference, the first in-person event hosted by Harvard WECode since the pandemic, was a smashing success, attracting over 600 attendees from across the globe and another 300 virtually. Victoria says, \u201cit was such an honor to be able to host the largest student-run conference for women in tech in the world, and to know that I helped create a space where students could feel inspired to pursue a technical field.\u201d",

When he isn\u2019t coding, Nisarg makes connections at hackathons, organizes community events, and serves as a community mentor.\n\nWhen he was 14 years old, Nisarg loved video games. This passion got him wondering about how they were developed, and through his curiosity, he eventually discovered Python and Pygame. Building retro versions of Pong and Snake awakened a deeper interest. He says, \u201cAs I continued to develop games and learn more about coding, I began to realize just how much I loved working with technology. There was something incredibly satisfying about taking an idea and turning it into a working program. I loved the problem-solving aspect of coding and the sense of accomplishment I felt when I finally got everything to work.\u201d\n\nJust two years later, Nisarg entered his first coding event: the 2018 Google Code-In Contest. He saw firsthand the power of collaboration to advance technology as everyone worked together to achieve spectacular results and create projects that affected positive change. The idea of community became an overarching theme for Nisarg, and he proceeded to join Major League Hacking (MLH), Code Newbie, and Hacktoberfest\u2014all ways to grow and bond over coding and tech. Opportunities these communities presented for him included content writing for Hashnode, contributing to open source efforts, and voice chatting with the MLH network about new technologies like Snyk Cybersecurity.\n\nNisarg first dove into hackathons at Hack in the North 2022. At the event, he discovered new platforms, languages,\u00a0 and problem-solving approaches as well as his potential to\u00a0 mentor others. He remembers, \u201cI would clear any doubt in the MLH Discord or provide assistance to those who had hackathon-related queries.\u201d Nisarg\u2019s willingness to give back was not limited to hackathons. He conducted a seminar on web development at his college, DEPSTAR. He also contributed to DecodeCafe, interviewing MLH hackers about their hackathon experiences. All of this involvement has shaped Nisarg into the mentor he is today.\n\nHe is proud to say, \u201cUltimately, I believe that my contributions have helped to make the hacker community a more welcoming and supportive place for everyone involved.\u201d His many roles within the community have allowed him to broaden his impact and reach many people in a relatively short time.

    "about": "Janet Zulu fell into coding mostly by chance. She was browsing YouTube when she discovered a video encouraging viewers to try and learn to code. Since that fateful day, she has thrown herself full force into programming, and has become an accomplished developer along the way.\n\nWhen she started at Texas A&M University \u2013 San Antonio, she knew computer science was her calling. She joined the hackathon community after attending her first hackathon, Veterans Codeathon 2021. It was there that she fell in love with hackathons and learned the importance of teamwork. As she says, \u201cCoding can be incredibly challenging, so keeping others motivated is essential. Learning more about the hackers around me and encouraging each other definitely helped me.\u201d\n\nHer first hackathon experience was not all smooth sailing. As she says, \u201cWhen I was invited to join, I felt overwhelmed with imposter syndrome. I reached out to my peers for advice on how to excel and contribute to the upcoming hackathon, but I was still nervous. As the hackathon began, I struggled to believe that I deserved the title of hacker.\u201d Once the event got underway, however, Janet gained confidence in her skills. Although her team did not win the event, they were extremely proud of their achievements.\n\nAfter her first hackathon, Janet participated in more events, some fraught with challenges, like HackUTD 2022, where she had to restart her project halfway through the competition. Others went down as more memorable than others. At TAMUhack 2023, Janet\u2019s team put their heads together and won the General Motors AI challenge. With the support of her peers, Janet has overcome the self-doubt she faced early in her hackathon career.\n\nAs a DREAMer (beneficiary of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act), Janet has faced numerous challenges and obstacles. Through education and a positive attitude, triumphing over the odds has become a habit. She has risen to become President of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and ACM\u2019s Women in Computing at Texas A&M. Her efforts to remove limitations for other DREAMer students have led to fundraising and transportation solutions for many coders. She says, \u201cI am proud to say that we have been able to take 36 students to hackathons completely free of charge, and all hackathons requiring travel for the fall 2023 semester are fully funded.\u201d Her compassionate approach inspires and motivates others in her community.",

Though she loved to create, and had always wanted to build battle dolls like in the manga Angelic Layer, she couldn\u2019t see a future for herself in tech. \u201cEven though the story encouraged young girls to achieve the impossible,\u201d she remembers, \u201cI still shied away from the industry based on the fact that I did not see many people who looked like me within it. As a black woman, entering in predominantly male spaces was intimidating and it discouraged me a lot from pursuing my interests.\u201d\n\nOnce she reached college, she realized she wasn\u2019t the only one impacted by a lack of representation in tech. Support from her campus community at the University of Georgia encouraged her to pursue computer science on her own terms. Her first leadership role on campus was Web Design Chair for Franklin Residential College, where she created an initiative showcasing her fellow community members\u2019 successes. Banibe also joined Girls.Code(), the sister organization to the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and was appointed as the Public Relations and Graphics Executive Board Member of ACM. She promoted the club's events and meetings by designing physical flyers and Instagram posts while working with the Membership Chair to increase engagement at meetings. The next year, Banibe was promoted to Vice President of ACM. This move was a game-changer. As she says, \u201cmy self-assurance continued to skyrocket.\u201d Self-doubt no longer held her back.\n\nBanibe was also appointed as Marketing Director for UGAHacks 8, where she played a crucial role in organizing the first Makeathon event. The event was a collaboration between the School of Computing and the School of Engineering to create a space where 250 makers could create and explore physical technology, such as 3D printing. Banibe 3D printed UGAHacks signs and used a laser cutter to create Makeathon awards. She also helped participants receive school credit for their projects. As a result of all her hard work, she is now in line to be the Lead Director of the upcoming UGAHacks9.\n\nBanibe\u2019s goal is to create a thriving community in which hackers support their peers and push each other to grow and learn. She says, \u201cWhether it is through organizing events, mentoring hackers, or providing resources for learning and growth, I believe that every little bit helps in creating a more inclusive and vibrant hacker community.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her work with UGAHacks, Banibe volunteered and mentored at HexLabs\u2019s 2022 hackathon and TechTogether Atlanta 2023. Banibe's commitment to promoting involvement and knowledge-sharing has made her invaluable to the tech community. Banibe's continued involvement in community events and her work as a Major League Hacking hackathon organizer will undoubtedly inspire others to follow their own paths into technology.",

Since her first hackathon in 2020, Bhawna has participated in many more, creating winning projects at more than 20 events. She\u2019s learned so much, from Android app development to Web3 and Blockchain. She is passionate about growing the hackathon community and guiding other students along their own paths in technology.\n\nBhawna got her first computer in 2017, and at the time wasn\u2019t even sure how to open it. She jumped right in anyway, teaching herself C# while working on a game with her friends. What began as a short learning experience to make a few small edits to the game became a love for programming which Bhawna says first inspired her to pursue a career in computer science. She fell in love with the aspect of problem-solving so many in the hacking community crave, and was eager to share her love of programming with others. After beginning her studies at the Hansraj University of Delhi, she realized the program focused more on theory than providing guidance and mentorship. She made it a priority to find opportunities to learn outside of school.\n\nShe signed up for several coding workshops and technical clubs, and was inspired to take the leap and register for Hack This Fall 2020 with a friend. At the event, they created their first app, DigiManager, which placed in the top 15 among more than 200 projects and won Best Use of GitHub. She was hooked! Through her involvement with the hacking community at events like HackHarvard, Hack The League, and hackCBS 5.0, Bhawna slowly found the passionate coding community she had missed at her university.\n\nBhawna first stumbled upon the Major League Hacking community after reading about someone being selected for the MLH Fellowship on her Twitter feed. Despite having no prior experience with Discord, Bhawna joined the server and found a mentor who helped her navigate the community and get involved. Bhawna says \u201coverall, my experience with the MLH Community has been transformative. It has not only provided me with a platform to develop my coding skills, but it has also enabled me to find a community of individuals who share my passion for programming. Through this community, I have been able to connect with individuals from all over the world, learn from their experiences, and contribute to the broader open-source community.\u201d\n\nEventually, Bhawna herself was accepted to the MLH Fellowship! It wasn\u2019t easy breaking into the tech scene, particularly as a student in a three-year degree program up against students with four-year technology degrees, but her experience in the hacking community outside of her classes gave her the experience she needed to hone her technical and interpersonal skills.\n\nShe has since organized her own hackathon, SheBuilds, which focuses on increasing the inclusion of women in tech. In January 2023, their first event attracted over 2,500 female college students and received more than 200 submissions. Bhawna says the most fulfilling part was hearing from students who had been inspired to declare a major in computer science. Recently, she was invited to speak at an event organized by Ordinateur which was attended by more than 800 people. She hopes to continue inspiring other students to pursue careers in tech, and shares her knowledge with others through her YouTube channel. This year, Bhawna returned to Hack This Fall as a mentor. Her hacking career has truly come full circle.",

    "about": "Since they were little, Harita and her little sister Sharada have had a knack for programming. When they first started learning on Code.org in elementary school, they were amazed by how their code could control video game characters. Soon after, Harita and Sharada registered for online programming courses by IBM and Georgia Tech, moving from Scratch to Python. When they reached junior high and found that their school didn\u2019t have any computer science classes or clubs, they realized most of their peers didn\u2019t have access to the same resources they had. Seeing major gaps in accessibility to technology, they dedicated themselves to doing something about it.\n\nIn 2020, Harita and Sharada founded Little Apple Academy, a nonprofit focused on teaching coding to students between the ages of 8 and 11. While they utilize Code.org lessons to get everyone on the same page, they were also inspired by their hackathon experience to create their own project-based curriculum for students.\n\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Harita and Sharada found it was difficult to collaborate with their friends, and decided to register for MakeSPP 2020. The collaborative hackathon environment inspired them to attend their next hackathon, SheBuilds, a few months later. Their project, COVID Aware, was a vaccine-access app which helped people in Hudson County, New Jersey find vaccine providers during times of severe supply shortages. Not only was COVID Aware awarded 1st place by the judges, but it also inspired them to develop projects addressing other issues close to home. To date, Harita and Sharada have created 13 apps to address real-world issues like climate change, gender equality, and domestic violence. On their hackathon experiences, Sharada says, \u201cwe feel empowered when working on real-world issues and solving problems with technology. Hackathons have inspired us to put the power of coding into the hands of so many more people.\u201d\n\nHarita and Sharada have since submitted winning projects at 10 other hackathons, including RoboHacks 2, Hack-Cade 2, Lily Hacks, and Give Back Hacks. The projects they\u2019ve created at hackathons have helped them build the foundation for the Little Apple Academy\u2019s curriculum. Their project-based program includes everything from block coding to Python to web development. Harita and Sharada have even organized their own hackathon, Little Apple Hacks, to help reduce the gender gap in technology. Several of their students have already gone on to win hackathons themselves!\n\nSharada says she and her sister believe that \u201cwith equitable access to computer science, we can create a more equitable future for all.\u201d They have already taught several rounds of classes with Little Apple Academy, reaching students of all backgrounds from 10+ countries. In collaboration with IEEE Kochi, IEEE Patna, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Harita and Sharada have shared resources with students in rural and underserved regions of India. Their Little Apple Academy students have written over 120,000 lines of code and created more than 450 Scratch projects. They have been recognized for their work with Little Apple Academy by PBS 13, NJ.com, and Code.org, and were also featured in The74\u2019s 16 Under 16. They plan to continue their careers in computer science and to continue bridging gaps in equity wherever they can.",

    "about": "Vibhor did not discover coding until the 11th grade, but after learning Python in class, he was hooked. While working on his 12th grade capstone project, Vibhor recalls feeling like an experienced developer for high-end software, brainstorming project ideas on a large whiteboard with his team. From that point on, Vibhor knew he wanted to work as a developer, and enrolled in a four-year B.Tech program for Computer Science at the Jaypee Institute of Information Technology to take his passion for coding to the next level.\n\nWhen he first arrived at college, Vibhor knew nothing about the hacker community\u2014he thought it was like something in a movie\u2014but he was inspired to learn more. He joined the only tech community available, the local chapter of Google Developer Student Clubs. Vibhor knew the club\u2019s rules did not allow first-year students to join, but he took the initiative to approach one of the seniors in the program and ask her directly. After he explained his passion for coding, she noticed his enthusiasm and decided to allow Vibhor to interview along with the upperclassmen. Vibhor stayed awake until 1 a.m. waiting on the results to come in via Facebook, and was overjoyed when his name appeared among the accepted candidates. Within a year, Vibhor was working with the club in a tech coordinator role, helping with events and organizing the club\u2019s annual hackathon. The following year, Vibhor had moved up to Head of Management and PR for the club, organized a national hackathon in India, and hosted a 6-day festival for app development in Flutter.\n\nVibhor himself attended his first hackathon just over 2 years ago, competing in Healthathon 2020. While he was new to hackathons, Vibhor was not new to hacking. In his free time, Vibhor had used his coding skills to create simple hacks aimed at convenience. For example, during his freshman year, he created a Python script which reduced the need to manually input user IDs and passwords for accessing campus internet. One project Vibhor is especially proud of was an automatic detection tool for facial paralysis, which helped to detect facial nerve palsy in a non-invasive way using image analysis.\n\nVibhor was the first in his family to pursue a career in tech. He credits the challenge of not having a set path to follow for his independence. Without specific guidance, Vibhor sought mentorship on his own and found it within the hacker community. Though he didn\u2019t get his start in tech until the 11th grade, Vibhor has quickly become a trusted tech advisor for his friends and family. Growing up, Vibhor remembers the struggle of convincing his family, and especially his father, to trust new technology. Now, Vibhor has made tech enthusiasts out of his entire family: his little brother following in his academic footsteps, his mother shopping online, and his father paying bills online rather than making a monthly trip the old-fashioned way.\n\nVibhor never turns down an opportunity to learn, even when it falls outside his area of expertise. He sees his career as the product of dedication, perseverance, and those all-hours \u201chustling nights\u201d when he learned so much. Vibhor has also enrolled in an online program to complete a BS in Data Science and Programming at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, which he will complete at the same time he graduates from his B.Tech program at the Jaypee Institute of Technology. He already has two job offers lined up after graduation! Vibhor\u2019s dedication to improving, learning, and mentoring will no doubt get him far in his future tech career.",

    "about": "He\u2019s still in high school, but Jeffrey Zang already has more than five years of programming experience under his belt. Jeffrey has been programming since the 5th grade, when he first learned about Scratch during a math class. Jeffrey says he was \u201cimmediately captivated by the magic of programming\u201d and enthralled by his newfound ability to recreate everything from Pong to Paper Minecraft. By the time he was in 6th grade, Jeffrey\u2019s father had introduced him to Python, and he had already completed basic programs like a pizza maker and a choose your own adventure game.\n\nBut by his freshman year of high school, Jeffrey had almost lost that spark for programming which burned so bright just a few years earlier. That spark was reignited when Jeffrey\u2019s friend invited him to attend JAMHacks 6, one of Canada\u2019s largest hackathons for high schoolers. Initially, Jeffrey balked at the request, unsure if he was ready for an intense commitment that would mean spending his first solo night away from home. Not to mention that Jeffrey had been considering changing his career path and pursuing opportunities in business rather than programming. However, just two days before the event, Jeffrey had a change of heart and decided to get a team together with his friend and come up with a project.\n\nTo this day, Jeffrey says JAMHacks was one of the most fun experiences he has ever had,\u00a0 fondly remembering his time learning in workshops, the power outage in the middle of the hackathon, and especially the free food. Jeffrey credits JAMHacks with reigniting his passion for programming. As a result of his hackathon experience, Jeffrey went on to learn React and got his first internship doing full-stack development for uxSino. While he had always appreciated the problem-solving aspect of programming, he says he really loves programming \u201cbecause of how it brings people together.\u201d\n\nSince his first hackathon, Jeffrey has gone on to compete in Hack the North and submit winning projects at Harvest Hacks and Give Back Hacks. While Jeffrey has been highly successful in his career for someone so young, not all opportunities have been easy to reach. After being rejected from numerous internships due to his age despite being otherwise qualified, Jeffrey and his friend decided to bridge this gap by organizing ClockHacks, their own hackathon geared towards other high schoolers.\n\nOrganizing ClockHacks came with its own set of challenges, as Jeffrey and his teammates were often written off by corporate sponsors due to their age. But Jeffrey persevered, and the event was a complete success. ClockHacks 2022 attracted more than 200 participants, and Jeffrey worked hard to ensure the fourteen workshops and activities scheduled provided as much knowledge as possible to participating hackers. Jeffrey wanted to make sure that hackers left the event with a reinvigorated or newfound passion for programming and technology.\n\nJeffrey continues to inspire others to pursue careers in tech. He spends his time outside of school tutoring his hackathon teammates and other students. This summer, Jeffrey will be organizing RythmHacks, with the mission of \u201ceducating aspiring youth about tech startups and entrepreneurship,\u201d as well as Hack the 6ix, one of the largest recurring hackathons in Canada.",
